[Isaac Brodsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaacbrodsky/), the CTO of Fused, delved into the power of Fused during a LinkedIn live session with [Matt Forrest](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbforr/). They discussed the contrast of Python vs. SQL for data analytics, the advantages of serverless geospatial processing, and showcased a live demo of the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/). During the demo, Isaac created a [User Defined Function](/guide/working-with-udfs/why-fused) visualize [Overture](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/buildings/) building footprints that are within a certain proximity of water.
