In an era where data-driven decisions are vital, accurate and scalable vegetation analysis plays a crucial role across various industries, from environmental monitoring to urban planning. While AI and machine learning have transformed image analysis, they often bring complexities and resource demands that aren't always practical for large-scale, real-time applications.

### **Making Vegetation Analysis Accessible**

This approach takes a different path. By leveraging classical computer vision techniques, it offers a straightforward, transparent way to perform vegetation segmentation that's scalable on a global level. Imagine processing satellite imagery tiles in real-time - analyzing vast geographic areas without the need for sophisticated AI models.

Traditionally, vegetation analysis relies on the [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)](https://gisgeography.com/ndvi-normalized-difference-vegetation-index/), which requires near-infrared (NIR) bands. However, acquiring NIR data globally can be challenging. Instead, the [Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI)](https://space4water.org/space/visible-atmospherically-resistant-index-vari) can be calculated using standard RGB bands, making it a practical alternative for large-scale surveys using widely available imagery. This example demonstrates how to simplify the process while offering full control over parameters and workflow, making it an ideal tool for large-scale applications.


### **Efficiently Scaling Classical Computer Vision**


Scaling vegetation analysis globally using classical computer vision methods presents unique challenges. While AI models can be powerful, they often come with significant resource demands, making them less suitable for widespread, real-time use.

This example is built on simplicity and scalability. By using classical computer vision, it bypasses the need for machine learning, allowing for transparent, user-defined parameters that can be easily adjusted for different regions or conditions. But how do you scale this to a global level?

The key lies in integrating Fused's [User Defined Function (UDF)](https://docs.fused.io/core-concepts/why/) with various map servers, such as the [ArcGIS World Imagery MapServer](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=10df2279f9684e4a9f6a7f08febac2a9), enabling the dynamic fetching and processing of satellite imagery tiles in real-time. This approach not only simplifies the segmentation process but also ensures it can be applied effectively on a global scale, making it a powerful tool for industries requiring large-scale environmental monitoring.

The UDF is designed to perform classical computer vision-based vegetation segmentation at a global scale, using satellite imagery tiles fetched from various map servers, such as the ArcGIS World Imagery MapServer. Here’s how it works:

**How It Works**:
1. **Input Parameters**: Users select their preferred vegetation index (such as VARI), and set threshold limits for segmentation.
2. **Vegetation Index Calculation**: The UDF extracts the necessary spectral bands and computes the vegetation index.
3. **Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) Calculation**: Using the zoom level, the UDF calculates the GSD, which determines the spatial resolution of the imagery.
4. **Segmentation and Processing**: The UDF applies thresholding, Gaussian smoothing, and morphological operations to refine the vegetation mask, allowing for precise identification of vegetation areas.

This combined approach ensures the UDF remains simple, flexible, and scalable, making it ideal for applications requiring extensive geographic coverage with transparent, easily adjustable processing steps. It's a powerful tool for global vegetation analysis, offering real-time insights across diverse regions without relying on complex machine learning models.
