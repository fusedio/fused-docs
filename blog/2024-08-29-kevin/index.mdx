In an era where data-driven decisions are vital, accurate and scalable vegetation analysis plays a crucial role across various industries, from environmental monitoring to urban planning. While AI and machine learning have transformed image analysis, they often bring complexities and resource demands that aren't always practical for large-scale, real-time applications.

## Making Vegetation Analysis Accessible

This approach takes a different path. By leveraging classical computer vision techniques, it offers a straightforward, transparent way to perform vegetation segmentation that's scalable on a global level. Imagine processing satellite imagery tiles in real-time - analyzing vast geographic areas without the need for sophisticated AI models.

Traditionally, vegetation analysis relies on the [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)](https://gisgeography.com/ndvi-normalized-difference-vegetation-index/), which requires near-infrared (NIR) bands. However, acquiring NIR data globally can be challenging. Instead, the [Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI)](https://space4water.org/space/visible-atmospherically-resistant-index-vari) can be calculated using standard RGB bands, making it a practical alternative for large-scale surveys using widely available imagery. This example, [Vegetation Segmentation](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/Vegetation_Segmentation), demonstrates how to simplify the process while offering full control over parameters and workflow, making it an ideal tool for large-scale applications.


## Efficiently Scaling Classical Computer Vision


Scaling vegetation analysis globally using classical computer vision methods presents unique challenges. While AI models can be powerful, they often come with significant resource demands, making them less suitable for widespread, real-time use.

This example is built on simplicity and scalability. By using classical computer vision, it bypasses the need for machine learning, allowing for transparent, user-defined parameters that can be easily adjusted for different regions or conditions. But how do you scale this to a global level?

The key lies in integrating Fused's [User Defined Function (UDF)](https://docs.fused.io/core-concepts/why/) with various map servers, such as the [ArcGIS World Imagery MapServer](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=10df2279f9684e4a9f6a7f08febac2a9), enabling the dynamic fetching and processing of satellite imagery tiles in real-time. This approach not only simplifies the segmentation process but also ensures it can be applied effectively on a global scale, making it a powerful tool for industries requiring large-scale environmental monitoring.



## Scalable Global Vegetation Segmentation


The UDF is designed to perform classical computer vision-based vegetation segmentation at a global scale, using satellite imagery tiles fetched from various map servers, such as the ArcGIS World Imagery MapServer. Here’s how it works:

**How It Works**:
1. **Input Parameters**: Users select their preferred vegetation index (such as VARI), and set threshold limits for segmentation.
2. **Vegetation Index Calculation**: The UDF extracts the necessary spectral bands and computes the vegetation index.
3. **Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) Calculation**: Using the zoom level, the UDF calculates the GSD, which determines the spatial resolution of the imagery.
4. **Segmentation and Processing**: The UDF applies thresholding, Gaussian smoothing, and morphological operations to refine the vegetation mask, allowing for precise identification of vegetation areas.

This combined approach ensures the UDF remains simple, flexible, and scalable, making it ideal for applications requiring extensive geographic coverage with transparent, easily adjustable processing steps. It's a powerful tool for global vegetation analysis, offering real-time insights across diverse regions without relying on complex machine learning models.


## The Power of Simplicity

Fused's serverless infrastructure empowers this UDF by delivering the computational power necessary for large-scale data processing, all without the hassle of managing servers or resources. By combining classical computer vision techniques with scalable cloud infrastructure, this solution supports real-time, global vegetation analysis. It's particularly suited for applications requiring extensive geographic coverage with transparent, easily adjustable processing steps.

This UDF offers a powerful solution for vegetation analysis, providing simplicity, transparency, and broad applicability on a global scale:

- **Global Scale, No AI Needed**: This UDF uses classical computer vision techniques that easily scale across vast geographic areas, enabling large-scale vegetation analysis without machine learning models.

- **Transparency and Efficiency**: The workflow is fully transparent, allowing for easy understanding and adjustment of each step, making the method cost-effective and straightforward to implement.

- **Broad Applicability**: Applicable globally using various satellite imagery sources, such as the ArcGIS World Imagery MapServer, this UDF is ideal for industries requiring extensive environmental monitoring, enabling real-time insights across diverse regions for informed decision-making.





## Bringing the UDF to Life



The scalability and simplicity of this UDF make it a versatile tool for a wide range of global applications:



- **Global Environmental Monitoring**: The UDF can be used to monitor vegetation health and changes on a global scale, helping organizations track deforestation, reforestation, and land degradation in near real-time.



- **Forestry Management**: This UDF is particularly useful for forestry applications, enabling large-scale monitoring of forest health, identifying vegetation stress, and detecting dead or dying trees. It helps forestry managers detect early signs of disease, pests, or environmental stressors, supporting conservation, reforestation, and sustainable forest management efforts.



- **Urban Planning and Green Space Management**: City planners can apply this UDF to monitor and manage urban green spaces, ensuring sustainable urban development and maintaining the ecological balance within cities.



- **Agriculture**: Farmers and agricultural agencies can use the UDF to assess crop health over large areas, enabling efficient resource allocation and early detection of potential issues like drought or disease.



This classical computer vision approach, combined with the flexibility to use various map servers like the ArcGIS World Imagery MapServer, allows for precise, scalable analysis across diverse landscapes, supporting informed decision-making in various industries.



## Empowering Global Analysis with Simple Tools



This UDF demonstrates the power of classical computer vision methods for vegetation analysis, especially when scaled globally. By integrating with map servers, users can efficiently monitor forest health, identify stressed or dead vegetation, and manage urban green spaces—all without the complexity of machine learning models.



The transparency and scalability of this approach make it accessible to a wide range of users, from environmental scientists to city planners, enabling effective resource management and informed decision-making on a global scale.
