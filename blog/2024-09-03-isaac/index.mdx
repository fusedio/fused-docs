In this video tutorial, I show a complete data app workflow in Fused. Starting with [exploring the data](/workbench/file-explorer/) in Fused, the tutorial walks through [developing a UDF](/core-concepts/write/) to serve the data, and then a [Fused App](/workbench/app-builder/) to share results.

With Fused, this whole workflow takes just minutes from beginning to end. Fused helps me visualize the data at every step, iterate on my analytical logic, and finally publish a dashboard.
