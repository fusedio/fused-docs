## What's the Big Idea?
My vision is to create an intuitive trip simulator that could seamlessly model urban mobility in Lima, Peru. While the idea is exciting, there are numerous challenges in development, from complex routing algorithms to managing population data effectively. In this blog post I will share how I've come to rethink these data engineering challenges...

Why this is important conceptually? What are the implications of building urban environments without up-to-date simulations?



## Redefining my developer experience
Two years ago, I created a trip simulator app that served data with Flask endpoints running on a Docker container, which required a dedicated server and significant setup time. As I began to explore Fused, I wondered if I could effortlessly revive this project, simplifying the process and eliminating the need for extensive infrastructure.



## Building instantly
The beauty of using Fused is that I can build and visualize the trip simulator in real-time, allowing anyone to interact with the app and experience data-driven insights on urban trips...
