There is a new type of team that combines operational data with commercial and open data. This idea in itself is not new but to take it direct to the end customer and team is. For example, Cloud Kitchens ships a map. But, it’s no ordinary store locator. They have invested significantly in internal tooling to identify undervalued assets. Which can give them market access and competitive advantage.

It comes down to real-estate arbitrage. What is the “value” of a location? From the recent 2024 All-In Summit, “we have a software stack that 100s of thousands of restaurants use, ... in the US we see 18% of transactions, ... because we see where all of the delivery is, we know where to put a delivery only restaurant facility, ... ” - Travis Kalanick.

The business model works by creating many micro kitchens in many locations and then offering the spaces to restaurateurs or brands.

Now this needs to be communicated to potential customers who might want to rent space. How can we use geospatial concepts/technology to achieve this?

Isochrone - We want to know how far from a location it can service within a certain drive distance or time. From this we can evaluate if this place has the metrics that align with the restaurant or business type. To do this we need a join key.

H3 - Is a spatial grid/index system originally developed at Uber but now in wide industry use. You can rapidly encode and join to other data sets.

Geolocation - Typing in an address returns back a latitude, longitude.

## There’s a Fused UDF for that!

Thanks to the community and team we can rapidly create this capability. A good approach is to take a look at what exists already and then adapt it to meet our specific needs.

1. Navigate the Fused UDF catalog
2. Find sample UDFs
3. Go to Fused UDF builder and customize
4. Ship!


## How do we do it?
We are going to combine Isochrones from Vahalla, Spatial SQL from DuckDB and H3 from the DuckDB extension. All interfacing through GeoPandas Dataframes.

Isochrone every tile centroid!
