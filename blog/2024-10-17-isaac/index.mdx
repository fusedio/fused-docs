In this video from the [FOSS4G](https://foss4g.org/) 2024 conference, [Isaac Brodsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaacbrodsky/), CTO and co-founder of Fused, shows the power of combining H3 with DuckDB to enhance geospatial data analysis.

As an example, Isaac shows a Fused [User Defined Function](/guide/working-with-udfs/writing-udfs) (UDF) that joins the [Overture Places](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/places/) dataset and the [Natura 2000](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/datahub/datahubitem-view/6fc8ad2d-195d-40f4-bdec-576e7d1268e4) biodiversity areas dataset, achieving significant reductions in file size and query execution times. He showcases how the integration allows for efficient data exploration, filtering, and real-time queries, emphasizing the power of DuckDB's [H3 extension](https://community-extensions.duckdb.org/extensions/h3.html) and [spatial extension](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/spatial/overview.html).


Isaac explains how H3 simplifies geospatial analytics by offering common spatial index to join datasets and enables efficient storage & processing by converting spatial features into 64-bit integers. Additionally, DuckDB enables developers to conveniently transition between Python and SQL. He also highlights how DuckDB can simplify data processing architectures by querying data in real-time from object storage systems such as S3.
