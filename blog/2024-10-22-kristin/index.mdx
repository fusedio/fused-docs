In [Part 1](/blog/the-strength-in-weak-data/), we explored county-level corn yield data and used Solar Induced Fluorescence (SIF) as our predictor. Now, we're unlocking how to **strengthen weak data** by merging multiple spatial data sources.

In this blog post, I'll show how I created a UDF to perform Zonal Statistics on a crop yield mask.

## Transforming Weak Data

Think of weak data as a puzzle with missing pieces. By combining different data sources, we complete the picture with clarity and confidence.

Let me take you to Lyon, the county in Iowa where I grew up:

import ImgK1 from '/blog/2024-10-22-kristin/k1.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

Farming isn’t static—corn fields rotate with soybeans or cover crops yearly, adding noise to our data. Here’s a 25 km² area:

import ImgK2 from '/blog/2024-10-22-kristin/k2.png';

</div>


This block includes not only farmland but also trees, towns, and water bodies. Our challenge is to isolate the specific areas where corn is grown to enhance the precision of our analysis. Enter Fused, which has a Public [CDLs UDF](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/CDLs_Tile_Example-a9f78d6d-4820-44ac-9032-5d19591e1a55) that reads the USDA Cropland Data Layer, letting me specify the year and crop type to pinpoint corn accurately.

## Masking crop areas with a UDF

To tackle this, I created a Fused UDF that loads the USDA Cropland Data Layer for a specified year and crop type to identify of corn-growing regions. I then used corn-growing regions to mask a Solar Induced Fluorescence raster, then calculate its mean values for each county.

Here's the magic:


1. **SIF Data:** Display SIF for a specific month from a NetCDF file.
2. **Corn Areas:** Map corn cultivation that year from a GeoTIFF file of the [Cropland Data Layer](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/) (CDL) data product.
3. **Precision Clipping:** Clip layers to show SIF values only where corn grows.
4. **Zonal Statistics:** Aggregate the SIF that incides on corn crops for each county.

You can see the UDF code [here](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Crop_Mask_Zonal_Statistics-dc1e6bf9-e2e6-4a1b-9061-094bc4825978) and even clone it to your Fused workspace.

</div>


**Voila!** From one county's weak data to creating summary statistics for the county. This provides the ingredients to boost the prediction strength and reducing noise in the prediction model we want to build.

## Scaling Up

Applying this to **400 Midwest counties** transforms our dataset from 400 to **60 million points**. The results?

- **Enhanced statistical power:** More data means more reliable predictions.
- **Improved accuracy:** Predictions align closely with actual outcomes.

## Simple with Fused

With Fused, working with rasters and vectors is straightforward. This blow post showed how I'm turning weak, unreliable data into a powerhouse of insights effortlessly.
