**TL;DR The Fused Team made Foursquare's open dataset of 100M global places accessible via GeoParquet files which you can access via a UDF.**

Foursquare just released an [open dataset](https://opensource.foursquare.com/os-places/) of over 100M global places of interest.

We at Fused have partitioned these points into easily accessible GeoParquet files, and hosted them on [Source Cooperative](https://source.coop/repositories/fused/fsq-os-places/description)

On top of that, we've build a [publicly available User Defined Function (UDF)](https://www.fused.io/public/UDF_Foursquare_Open_Source_Places) that anyone can use to easily look at & download to GeoJSON, all from the browser
