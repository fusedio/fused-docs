## Intro

As the Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Vida, I work daily with large, multidimensional geospatial datasets to determine the future risks to infrastructure from climate change globally. These risks and hazards are important information for those investing in infrastructure so they can accurately assess investments and comply with newer climate regulations, such as the EU Taxonomy.

Vida uses dozens of the latest generation of climate models to have the most up-to-date climate information, collectively part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). These models provide a range of possible futures, under different emission scenarios, as well as differences in how each model does its forecast. Using this information, we can create ensembles from the models, and have higher confidence in the risks and hazards we derive from the models, and which we present to our customers.

## Problem

At Vida, we derive dozens of risk metrics from CMIP6 and derive possible hazards from their outputs such as from flooding risk, drought, tornados, and many more. We write datasets to either Zarr or Cloud-Optimized GeoTiff so that we can efficiently stream in the data that we need. One of the best ways to sanity check our outputs and the data we give our customers is through visualizing it.

Prior to using Fused, much of this visualization was ad-hoc, using tools such as matplotlib or xarray to generate plots locally and then sharing them around as image files as we checked client sites. While this does work, it builds a lot of friction into the feedback cycle, and to focus on a single site or area, we’d have to rerun our visualization pipeline.

## Creating the UDF

With Fused, we’ve been able to easily interactively pre-process and visually inspect the Zarrs that we generate as the output from our models. Being able to just share a link to a UDF to view the data in an interactive map has greatly sped up exploring the model outputs, and sanity check the data that we are using.




## Conclusion

My experience with Fused has made it a lot easier for me to load, preprocess, and visualize the large datasets I work with and share those across my team. We make a lot of Zarrs, all of which we put on the cloud, so our internal workflow of creating datasets, saving them as Zarrs, and sharing the outputs among the team has been improved thanks to Fused.

My experience with Fused is that it’s a lot easier visualizing than sharing pngs to people in the team. Fused streamlines our internal workflows to create zars, throw them on Google Cloud, then create, run, and share climate models and their outputs.
