Dr. Qiusheng Wu is an Associate Professor of Geography and Sustainability at the [University of Tennessee](https://faculty.utk.edu/Qiusheng.Wu) and a Founding Editorial Board Member at the [Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum (CNG)](https://cloudnativegeo.org/). As part of his commitment to making open-source geospatial analysis and visualization more accessible, he has developed several widely used open-source packages, including [geemap](https://geemap.org/), [leafmap](https://leafmap.org/), and [segment-geospatial](https://samgeo.gishub.org/).

In [this Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JUupA0f5xJ_2QMqI6xrsEnLqIGXhB6le?usp=sharing) Qiusheng shows a few examples of how Cloud Native Geospatial datasets help you easily load data into a Jupyter Notebook environment using leafmap. His practical examples showcase how you can call the [Overture Maps UDF](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Overture_Maps_Example-64071fb8-2c96-4015-adb9-596c3bac6787) and [Foursquare Places UDF](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Foursquare_Open_Source_Places-5cd75ead-e319-4279-8efc-04276de145bc) to load data into a custom area of interest and render it in a leaflet map.

## Calling Fused UDFs to load data

You first use leafmap to create a bounding box over an area of interest (AOI) `user_aoi` and create a GeoDataFrame `gdf_aoi` with it. Then, you can [run](https://docs.fused.io/core-concepts/run-udfs/) the [Overture Maps UDF](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Overture_Maps_Example-64071fb8-2c96-4015-adb9-596c3bac6787), passing the AOI as a parameter to define the area to fetch data for.

Behind the scenes, the the Overture UDF reads data directly from the Overture Maps dataset hosted in [Source Cooperative](https://source.coop/repositories/fused/overture/description).


```python showLineNumbers
import fused
import geopandas as gpd
from shapely.geometry import shape

# Define AOI, which can be done with leafmap drawing tools
user_aoi = {'type': 'Feature','properties': {},'geometry': {'type': 'Polygon','coordinates': [[[-74.025621, 40.699967],[-74.025621, 40.730283],[-73.966055, 40.730283],[-73.966055, 40.699967],[-74.025621, 40.699967]]]}}

# Convert drawing to GeoDataFrame
gdf_aoi = gpd.GeoDataFrame([user_aoi['properties']], geometry=[shape(user_aoi['geometry'])])

# Fetch Overture Bulidings GDF with Fused UDF
gdf = fused.run("UDF_Overture_Maps_Example", bbox=aoi)
```
