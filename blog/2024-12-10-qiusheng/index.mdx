Dr. Qiusheng Wu is an Associate Professor of Geography and Sustainability at the University of Tennessee and a Founding Editorial Board Member at the Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum (CNG). As part of his commitment to making open-source geospatial analysis and visualization more accessible, he has developed several widely used open-source packages, including geemap, leafmap, and segment-geospatial.

In this blog post, Qiusheng shows a few examples of how you can leverage Cloud Native Geospatial datasets using Leafmap. His practical examples showcase foundations to start working with Overture Buildings and Foursquare Places datasets.
