Dr. Qiusheng Wu is an Associate Professor of Geography and Sustainability at the University of Tennessee and a Founding Editorial Board Member at the Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum (CNG). As part of his commitment to making open-source geospatial analysis and visualization more accessible, he has developed several widely used open-source packages, including [geemap](https://geemap.org/), [leafmap](https://leafmap.org/), and [segment-geospatial](https://samgeo.gishub.org/).

In [this Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JUupA0f5xJ_2QMqI6xrsEnLqIGXhB6le?usp=sharing) Qiusheng shows a few examples of how Cloud Native Geospatial datasets help you easily load data into a Jupyter Notebook environment using leafmap. His practical examples showcase how you can call the [Overture Maps UDF](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Overture_Maps_Example-64071fb8-2c96-4015-adb9-596c3bac6787) and [Foursquare Places UDF](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Foursquare_Open_Source_Places-5cd75ead-e319-4279-8efc-04276de145bc) to load data into a custom area of interest and render it in a leaflet map.
