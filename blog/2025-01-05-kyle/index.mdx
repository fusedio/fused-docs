Pilot Fiber is a commercial Internet Service Provider primarily serving customers in New York City. Our primary value proposition in competing with national-scale ISPs is our commitment to customer service– we actually do care when any type of incident interrupts your service and will immediately jump into action to address the cause.

### Introduction



Almost all fiber optic cable in Manhattan runs through a shared manhole-and-duct system, meaning that road construction or work by other providers in a manhole has the potential to damage the equipment of multiple providers. Because of this, Pilot uses an active fiber monitoring system across our network; devices located in our data centers are constantly shooting light down the fibers in our network and looking for any anomalies in comparison to a “fingerprint” stored when that fiber was initially installed to a building.

When that system registers an anomaly, it will immediately fire an alert giving a fiber route and distance to the potential problem (i.e. “There is a light loss on the fiber running to 1234 5th Ave at a distance of 2.351 kilometers from the data center.”). When this happens, our teams need to be moving within minutes to determine the exact location of the issue and, if necessary, get crews headed to the site to begin repairs.

## Body

Historically, this process would require the attention of an Outside Plant engineer with access to specialized software and network knowledge, regardless of the time of day or day of the week. With Fused we are working to make this information accessible to more support team members and automate the creation of the reports field crews need to address the issue when they arrive on site.
Using Fused as a back-end glue layer, we have built a web app that allows a less technical user to select a route and distance and map where the system says the fault occurred, view nearby network infrastructure, and automatically generate the necessary field reports based on that nearby infrastructure.
The workflow requires a series of calls to UDFs that act as intermediaries to a Postgres/PostGIS layer, which in turn is sourcing data from other internal sources. This structure allows us to easily keep the business logic organized at the UDF layer while limiting the scope of data access and security via Postgres and internal processes maintaining the sync.
The basic process is seen below:


When the user selects a route and a distance to process, two separate processes are initiated. One retrieves the selected route to load onto the Mapbox-based map within the app, while the second kicks off a processing chain. This chain is utilizing UDFs that both assist in isolating the location of the fault and relevant nearby infrastructure as well as adding elements to the map display to assist the user in visualizing what may be occurring.

UDF - returning the route itself that will show up on the map.
UDF  get fault point php
UDF - putting the red dot on the map.
UDF - generate the splice report.

Providing non-technical users a way to have access to the data in Postgres this democratizes where you could have theoretically anybody at the company gather the information to get the splice team headed in the right direction as fast as possible and know what they're looking for and what they're looking at when they get there. All this person would need to know is what the distance was and what building was affected. By using these different UDFs and Postgress the tool will figure out the point and if relevant, it will generate the documentation that they need to give to the field crew. This improves the turnaround time we dispatch somebody to the site.
I could do a lot of this just with Python but there were no visual maps to work with in these scenarios. Fused works so easily with the map and the calculations also give a lot of context to the person who is running it. So even our more technical personnel can see and make a judgment call about what they think is actually happening or not happening here.
