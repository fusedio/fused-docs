# Announcing Fused 2.0

We're excited to announce Fused 2.0! With this new release we're rolling out:

- A new Workbench experience with Collections
- Introducing a simpler way to run multiple UDFs with `fused-py` with `fused.submit()`
- Improved & simpler caching for faster & cheaper UDFs

And a host of changes in the backend

## A whole new Workbench

### Introducing Collections: A simple way to organize your UDFs

{/* GIF of Collections would be cool */}

### Redesign UDF Editor

{/* 
Topics:
- Split screen Editor & Module 
- Ability to Full Screen Map view
- Visualization under the UDF tab to you can edit it while in full screen map view
 */}

### A New Share Page

{/* GIF of Share page */}
{/* 
Topics:
- Sharing your UDFs is now easier than before. Rather than being under the "Settings Tab" as before, it's now under a dedicated "Share" button that allows you to easily see an image preview, access all the tokens to share & edit the description, all in 1 place
 */}

## Changes to `fused-py`

We're also bringing a host of changes to `fused-py` to make processing data in Python simpler, from a small one time task to processing huge datasets

### Simplifying how Fused handles geometries

We're moving away from Fused having many different `fused.types` to only having 2 simple types: `fused.types.Bounds` and `fused.types.Tile`. 

### [`fused.submit()`](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#running-multiple-jobs-in-parallel) for simple, multi job runs

### Improved caching

## More to come!

We're continuously releasing more features to Fused and we want to hear how you're using Fused for your own projects!
