# Announcing Fused 2.0

{/* We're excited to announce Fused 2.0! With this new release we're rolling out:

- A new Workbench experience with Collections
- Introducing a simpler way to run multiple UDFs with `fused-py` with `fused.submit()`
- Improved & simpler caching for faster & cheaper UDFs

And a host of changes in the backend */}

## A New UDF Editor in Workbench

{/* Show a GIF of workbench */}

### Introducing Collections: A simple way to organize your UDFs

Collections now allows you to organize your UDFs together as you work on different projects. 

{/* GIF of Collections: for ex: LULC Collection, then BUilding height estimation */}

### Redesigned UDF Editor

We've moved things around in UDF Editor:
- Adding a new Full Screen Map View
- The Visualize Tab is now under the UDF expanded parameters, allowing you to hide your Code Editor and just focus on tweaking the visualization of your data
- Split screen "Editor" & "Module" on top of each other: Keeping your code clean in the main "Editor" Tab is now easier by moving functions under the "Module" tab.

{/* 
TODO GIF:
- Need to show Visualize Parameters
- Wrap some code in function under "Editor" and move to "Module" to show how it's more readable
*/}

### A New Share Page

We've moved all the tools & information you need to easily share your UDFs into a dedicated page (and button). You can easily:
- Create a token to share your UDFs 
- Edit the Description, Tags & Image preview of your UDFs

{/* 
TODO GIF: 
- Show where Share button is
- Edit Description
- Share UDF with HTTP to show where sharing options are
 */}

## Changes to `fused-py`

Our Python library `fused-py` is getting some updates to make processing data in Python simpler, from a small one time task to processing huge datasets

### Simplifying how Fused handles geometries

- Moving away from Fused having [many different `fused.types`](/core-concepts/filetile/#legacy-types) to only having 2 simple types: [`fused.types.Bounds`](/core-concepts/filetile/#fusedtypesbounds) and [`fused.types.Tile`](/core-concepts/filetile/#fusedtypestile). 
{/* TODO: Need to link to new `bounds` section in docs + new Legacy `bbox` section */}
- Changed the main argument to pass geometries to a Fused UDF from `bbox` to the more common and generic `bounds` keyword.

### [`fused.submit()`](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#running-multiple-jobs-in-parallel) for simple, multi job runs

We're introducing `fused.submit()` as a simple way to run many UDFs all at once in parallel

<details>
<summary>See `fused.submit` in action</summary>

    ```python showLineNumbers
    @fused.udf
    def single_job_udf(val):
        import pandas as pd
        return pd.DataFrame({'val':[val]})
    ```

    Running this UDF 10 times in parallel:

    ```python showLineNumbers
    job_pool = fused.submit(udf, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
    ```

    And retrieve all the results:

    ```python showLineNumbers
    processed_df = job_pool.collect_df()
    ```
</details>

This can significantly speed up parallel tasks like:
- Fetching lots of individual data points from an API
- Scaling small processing steps to lots of data points

### Improved caching

Under the hood we've significantly improved how Fused caches results of recurring UDFs & cached functions + we've introduced new tools for developers to control caching:
- A default 90 days cache time for all UDFs
- Editing the cache duration with the new [`cache_max_age` argument](/core-concepts/cache/#defining-your-cache-lifetime-cache_max_age)
