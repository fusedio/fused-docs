# Announcing Fused 2.0

**Fused 2.0 is our biggest update to date, with changes across Workbench & `fused-py`!**

### A New UDF Editor in Workbench

#### Introducing Collections: A simple way to organize your UDFs

Collections now allows you to organize your UDFs together as you work on different projects, save them together and keep your editor focused on the project at hand.

:::note
Collection is still in early access so you need to enable it under "Preferences -> Enable UDF Collections [Beta]" to access it
:::

#### Redesigned UDF Editor

UDF Editor now comes with a host of new features & redesigned UI:
- Adding a new Full Screen Map View
- The Visualize Tab is now under the UDF expanded parameters, allowing you to hide your Code Editor and just focus on tweaking the visualization of your data
- Split screen "Editor" & "Module" on top of each other: Keeping your code clean in the main "Editor" Tab is now easier by moving functions under the "Module" tab.

{/* 
TODO GIF (waiting for final design):
- Need to show Visualize Parameters
- Wrap some code in function under "Editor" and move to "Module" to show how it's more readable

#### A New Share Page

We've moved all the tools & information you need to easily share your UDFs into a dedicated page (and button). You can easily:
- Create a token to share your UDFs 
- Edit the Description, Tags & Image preview of your UDFs

### Changes to `fused-py`

Our Python library `fused-py` is getting some updates to make processing data in Python simpler, from a small one time task to processing huge datasets

#### Simplifying how Fused handles geometries

- Moving away from Fused having [many different `fused.types`](/core-concepts/filetile/#legacy-types) to only having 2 simple types: [`fused.types.Bounds`](/core-concepts/filetile/#fusedtypesbounds) and [`fused.types.Tile`](/core-concepts/filetile/#fusedtypestile). 
- Replacing `bbox` object with [`bounds`](/core-concepts/filetile/#the-bounds-object): a more generic term to pass geometries to UDFs

#### [`fused.submit()`](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#running-multiple-jobs-in-parallel) for simple, multi job runs

We're introducing `fused.submit()` as a simple way to run many UDFs all at once in parallel

![fused.submit() demo](/img/announcements/fused-submit-demo.png)

This can significantly speed up parallel tasks like:
- Fetching lots of individual data points from an API
- Scaling small processing steps to lots of data points

#### Improved caching

Under the hood we've significantly improved how Fused caches results of recurring UDFs & cached functions + we've introduced new tools for developers to control caching:
- A default 90 days cache time for all UDFs
- Editing the cache duration with the new [`cache_max_age` argument](/core-concepts/cache/#defining-your-cache-lifetime-cache_max_age)
