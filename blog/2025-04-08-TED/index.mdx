# Fused featured in Maxar TED Talk

![Fused Powering Maxar](/img/announcements/TED_Fused_Maxar.png)

Fused is excited to be featured in a [TED Talk today](https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_wilczynski_the_multidimensional_magic_of_modern_maps) by Peter Wilczynski, CPO at Maxar, which explored a multi-source site monitoring scenario of Vancouver's greening initiatives over the past five years powered by the Fused platform.

Site monitoring scenarios are at their most effective when data from disparate sources is combined—from satellite imagery and map data to municipal and demographic data. Analytics today requires bringing all these different sources of data together: from raw pixels to contextual intelligence — in real-time, seamlessly, and at scale.

This is an iterative process, each dataset being in its own format & hosted on different cloud providers, updated independently and on different schedules.

Fused is built by [data scientists, engineers & open source contributors](/blog/why-fused/) who know the reality of building pipelines with breaking changes in libraries, new file formats that require rethinking how data is ingested and business requirements that constantly change.

We firmly believe we need tools that help us bring as many datasets together as possible, especially in a world where LLMs and AI can increasingly [talk directly to data](/blog/announcing-fused-ai-builder/).

If you’d like to try out an instance of the Fused workbench with pre-loaded data from Maxar later this month, which Peter demoed on screen, sign up for the waitlist on [fused.maxar.com](https://fused.maxar.com/) to get access and see for yourself this is more than a pre-recorded tech demo!
