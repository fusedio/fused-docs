# Fused Powering Maxar

![Fused Powering Maxar](/img/announcements/TED_Fused_Maxar.png)

{/* _**“Quote goes here” –  Peter Wilczynski**_ */}

Fused is excited to be featured in a [TED Talk today](https://conferences.ted.com/ted2025/program#day-73697) by Peter Wilczynski, CPO at Maxar, and to **launch a dedicated instance of Maxar powered by the Fused platform** at [fused.maxar.com](http://fused.maxar.com).

Maxar’s imagery is at its best when combined with partners providing third party imagery and open source datasets like Vancouver’s Open Data Portal. Analytics today requires bringing all these different sources of data together: from raw pixels to contextual intelligence — in real-time, seamlessly, and at scale.

This is an iterative process, each dataset being in its own format & hosted on different cloud providers, updated independently and on different schedules.

Fused is built by [data scientists, engineers & open source contributors](/blog/why-fused/) who know the reality of building pipelines with breaking changes in libraries, new file formats that require rethinking how data is ingested and business requirements that constantly change.

We firmly believe we need tools that help us bring as many datasets together as possible, especially in a world where LLMs and AI can increasingly [talk directly to data](/blog/announcing-fused-ai-builder/).

If you’d like to try out Fused with Maxar, which Peter demoed on screen, **[sign up for the waitlist](https://go.maxar.com/fused-waitlist) to get access** and see for yourself this is more than a pre-recorded tech demo!
