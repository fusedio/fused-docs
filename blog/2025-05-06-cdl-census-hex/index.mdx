# Repartitioning Crop Data Layer & US Census into H3 hexagons

Fused has repartitioned the USDA [Crop Data Layer](https://pdi.scinet.usda.gov/portal/apps/sites/#/cropcros) and [US Census](https://data.census.gov/) into H3 hexagons.

These 2 datasets are both available on [Source Cooperative](https://source.coop/repositories/fused/hex/description) for anyone to use, free of charge!

### What are these datasets?

We've taken 2 popular datasets and made them available in H3 Hexagons, this provides a number of benefits:
- Much faster ability to aggregate data at different scales
- A simple way to join datasets together (as they, and any other H3 tiled dataset are using the same grid)

You can read more about [H3 Indexes](https://h3geo.org/) on the dedicated page.

We're providing:

1. Crop Data Layer

- Available for `[2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022, 2024]`
- Available in `hex7` and `hex8` resolutions

2. US Census Data

- Available for `2020`
- Available in `hex7` and `hex8` resolutions

### Using these datasets

These datasets are completely free for anyone to use, with or without Fused. To showcase what's possible we have made a [public Fused UDF](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/CDL_from_source_coop-d6f88129-73e3-469b-8ac4-7793c2acbeed) anyone can use without an account to explore these.
