# Inside Fused Apps: Python Workflows in The 

At Fused, we’re building tools to help data scientists work more efficiently: we want to give them the ability to work on any dataset, create an analysis and scale it to the whole world with just a few lines of code. But data scientists don’t work in a vacuum, and analysis aren’t (always) done because people are simply curious about a topic. In the spirit of allowing a single person to do all the work themselves, **we’re launching Fused Apps**, a way to build a Python-based workflow in your browser, that you can save and share with someone.

In this first episode of Inside Fused, a series of blogposts about how we’re building Fused, we want to take you behind the curtain to show how Fused Apps is built.

### Fused Apps at a glance

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

Fused provides both a Python package to run User Defined Functions (UDFs), and Workbench, a browser-based IDE to write, execute, visualize them as well as create Fused Apps to make interactive frontends. 

Here’s what Fused Apps look like:

_Fused Apps. From left to right: the list of apps that have been loaded in Workbench, the app code editor, and the running app itself._

The App code editor & renderer allow users to write their own Python code using [Streamlit](http://streamlit.io) to build a frontend entirely in Python, a language most data scientists already work with.

We want data scientists to be able to go from “hey, that’s a cool idea” to “here’s what it looks like” without tech getting in their way. Especially in a world where AI tools make writing code simpler, the bottleneck becomes speed at which one can execute & ship code, not write it 

### How we built it

In short Fused Apps offer a frontend application for users to write Python code with Streamlit, and a backend that saves & serves these apps and provides shareable links

Originally, we didn’t even have a way for people to save their apps, our internal workflow while developing & testing this was to have a Slack channel where we pasted our app links in to be able to find them later on

![Early days Slack sharing links](/img/blog/2025-05-13-inside-fused-apps/Slack_app_sharing_early_days.png)

This is how our development tends to happen: Build a prototype, use it a bunch and find the pain points, then fix those. In this case, saving & tracking apps was the next piece to build.

This is how we added functionality like Github integration, sharing options, and an app catalog. All these were only added after we got some traction internally and from early customers.

Fused Apps are built on top of [Stlite](https://github.com/whitphx/stlite) & [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Streamlit being a library allowing you to write a frontend application, entirely in Python and Stlite an in-browser version of Streamlit. This allows people familiar with Python but not so much frontend development (like data scientists) to have something rendered on screen in HTML, but only with writing Python. 

Stlite provides the ability to run apps in the browser, and while [Stlite Sharing](https://edit.share.stlite.net/) does support URL-encoded mechanisms for app sharing, the URL is the same as the code, preventing users from updating said code; there’s also no such thing as app catalogs, etc. So we ended up using Stlite as the engine and built a product experience around that. 

### Python, in the browser

We use [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) to run Python in WASM. This enables the same Python language to be used in a new environment – the browser. The browser environment is key because it gives us a way to safely ship applications to users.

{/* TODO: Isaac wanted to expand on these */}
Safely shipping software to people wasn’t always the simplest. Previous efforts via Flash, ActiveX, and Java applets enabled a generation of rich web content. These technologies [died out](https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2016/07/20/reducing-adobe-flash-usage-in-firefox/) mainly because of security model problems.

At the time of writing this, in mid 2025, browser applications are considered well sandboxed (with the possible exceptions of RowHammer/Spectre type issues), browser applications open when you want them, and go away completely when you dismiss them, all the while performing more and more complex tasks. Browser applications handle video encoding/decoding for video conferencing, graphics rendering for games, maps, and design, and more frequently, for programming. Companies like Figma are building complex, professional grade applications for [the browser first](https://www.figma.com/blog/meet-us-in-the-browser/).

From a development perspective, the browser becomes an operating system. It becomes less important to know what exact hardware & underlying operating system the users have, and we develop applications for the browsers’ APIs. Those applications are inherently portable to new devices, because the heavy lifting is porting the browser to these new devices.

_Fused Apps work on *any* device, as long as there's a browser!_

### Building a Product

Beyond the technical challenges we want to build a product that helps data scientists build, iterate and ship faster. Part of this product vision is allowing users can then quickly generate a link for their apps and send them to anyone. This allows our users with a way to quickly share an interactive frontend for their data or analysis to anyone, technical or not. A data scientist can build an analysis that takes in different parameters and make an interactive graph for their project manager to test out directly all without needing support.

### What can we expect from Pyodide

Fused Apps, and any implementation of Python in the browser, isn’t as customizable as a fully local setup. Packages with native code that are not prebuilt for WASM will not work. At the time of writing, some popular packages like Pandas & Numpy are built and supported, but others aren’t. The backbone of the map processing pipeline, GDAL, for example, isn’t currently supported. This isn’t from lack of popularity, but reflects the complexity of building GDAL.

Some packages will need architecture updates. As another example people currently call into ffmpegfrom Python using the CLI. The WASM environment does not have a CLI concept, and this would need to be replaced with library calls. Other packages which are not well suited to this architecture (such as Torch) might have alternatives developed because the wasm ecosystem is so attractive a development target.

Moving large amounts of data in and out of the browser is slow, so data-intensive libraries like Torch or Dask are not well-suited for this. We solve this by bringing in the compute performance & flexibility of Fused UDFs, which run native (non-WASM) Python in a cloud environment. Fused UDFs run code much closer to the data, improving performance, and are not limited by what packages are available for Pyodide, improving flexibility.

Install times for Pyodide are relatively long from a user point of view, as the application isn’t stored locally and installed each time it's opened. This will most likely keep improving over time as the technology is developed further. For example Pyodide wants to add memory snapshotting to help with this, but it isn’t stable yet.

This is a fast changing ecosystem though, for example we’ve made a small contribution of a build of the [H3 package](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/5436/) specifically because we wanted to have H3 supported in Python in the browser.  The list of [supported packages](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html) built in Pyodide is growing quickly.

### Near-zero cost

Fused Apps are part of the free tier of Fused. You can use Fused Apps without logging in at all, and with a free login you can save and share your apps. We want to take a moment here to explain why this is naturally a free offering and will continue to be free.

As a browser-based application, all of the code execution and data transfer happens in the user's browser. This means that we do not need to sandbox code execution or pay for cloud compute resources to run anyone’s Fused Apps. 

Where we do incur costs are in the shared control plane layer of Fused.  As a result, the incremental cost of serving an app user is very low and it is easy for us to offer that for free. The core offering of Fused is the backend serverless execution of code, which is our paid product.

### Using Fused Apps

Recently we announced re-partitioning the Crop Data Layer dataset into H3 hexagons for anyone to use and [hosted the resulting dataset](https://source.coop/repositories/fused/hex/description) on Source Cooperative. 

Alongside this we created a [public Fused App](https://www.fused.io/workbench/apps/catalog/CDL_hex5_visualize-d6484ff1-e2b4-42a8-b788-6baa738955a1) allowing you to explore any crop for the 2024 dataset.

As we mentioned, Fused Apps are free and don’t require login. You can check out our [catalog of public Apps](https://www.fused.io/workbench/apps/catalog?tab=public) in Fused Workbench.

### Help us build the future of data science workflows!

We firmly believe data scientists need tools that give them the independence to do their work rather than asking for support to scale their analysis or share their results. 

We need smart people to help us build all of this. We are hiring for:
- Deep knowledge of Python, Pyodide
- Opinionated thinking in building the future of data science pipelines
- People wanting to join a fast moving startup and build things
