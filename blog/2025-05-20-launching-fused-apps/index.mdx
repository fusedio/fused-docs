# Launching Fused Apps

Today we're launching Fused Apps, allowing you to write Python in the browser, creating, editing & sharing interactive apps 

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

<ReactPlayer
    playsinline={true}
    className="video__player"
    playing={true}
    muted={true}
    controls
    style={{ height: '100% !important' }}
    width="100%"
    url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/blogs/2025-05-13-inside-fused-apps/Introducing_fused_apps_intro.mov"
/>

Watch the announcement video: 

<ReactPlayer playsinline={true} className="video__player" playing={false} muted={false} controls height="30vh" width="100%" url="https://youtu.be/yjiNxqAcPdw" alignItems='center'/>

## üêç Write Python in the browser

Fused Apps are one of the the fastest way to write Python, directly in the browser. 
- No environment setup, just start writing Python
- Create interactive apps using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) 
- Save & rename your Apps


## üîó Share your apps with anyone

As soon as you save your Fused App, you can create a shareable link for anyone to open

<ReactPlayer
    playsinline={true}
    className="video__player"
    playing={true}
    muted={true}
    controls
    style={{ height: '100% !important' }}
    width="100%"
    url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/blogs/2025-05-13-inside-fused-apps/sharing_fused_apps_links_higher_res.mp4"
/>

## üîí Standalone & Private, running in your browser 

Fused Apps are built on top of [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) & [Stlite](https://stlite.net/) but offer many features:
- Github Integration for team collaboration
- Run light-weight LLMs locally in your browser with libraries like [`transformers.js.py`](https://github.com/whitphx/transformers.js.py)

## üìö Access a Catalog of existing Fused Apps to get started

We've curated a [catalog of existing Fused Apps](https://www.fused.io/workbench/apps/catalog?tab=all) to get you started, including:
- üåΩ [Explore different crops around the US](https://www.fused.io/app/UDF_Explore_CDL_app)
- üõ∞Ô∏è [Visualize the trend of objects sent to Space](https://www.fused.io/app/UDF_Objects_to_space)
- üå≤ [Pan a map of Forest statistics per global municipality](https://www.fused.io/app/UDF_Zonal_Stats_Forest_App)

## How we built Fused Apps: Technical Details

We wrote a dedicated technical blog post going into details of how Fused Apps are built:
- How we originally built Fused Apps
- The challenges of Python in the browser
- Our approach to building a product

## Customer Highlight: Join us for a Webinar with [BCG]

On Thursday May 22nd we'll be hosting a webinar with Boston Consulting Group to discuss how they use Fused:

"How BCG uses Fused to scale Agricultural Insights Worldwide with H3"
