# Scaling Environmental Insights with Fused and H3

Farmers and analysts face a familiar challenge: weather and crop data is fragmented, slow to process, and hard to act on.

We worked with Emma Quirk (Senior Data Analyst at BCG) and Majid Alivand (Senior Data & Analytics Manager at BCG) to showcase how Fused can help bring all these datasets together.


import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'
import LazyReactPlayer from '@site/src/components/LazyReactPlayer'

<LazyReactPlayer
    playsinline={true}
    className="video__player"
    muted={true}
    justifyContent="center"
    controls
    style={{ height: '100% !important' }}

Building useful & actionable weather models for environmental insights requires bringing datasets from:
- Different sources
- Different resolutions
- Different formats

Emma & Majid share how they're using Fused + H3 tiles to bring together datasets like GridMET, CDL, LANID irrigation, and gSSURGO by converting them from raster to H3 tiles to build unified, high-resolution datasets they can work on.

By building UDFs to manipulate each dataset, the team can iterate on their analysis in seconds while H3 tiles allow them to more easily combine all the datasets together.

## Why H3?

{/* TODO: Link to H3 page https://docs.fused.io/deep-dives/hex/why-hexagons/ */}

- Harmonized format across datasets and regions
- Scalable queries at multiple resolutions
- Compact storage parquets with improved spatial performance
- No reprojection needed for global analyses
- Equal neighbors for clean spatial logic
