# Fused is now SOC 2 Type 1 compliant!

We're excited to announce that Fused has achieved SOC 2 Type 1 compliance. This is a significant milestone for us, as it demonstrates our commitment to security and transparency.

At Fused, we want to allow all data teams to get work done quickly. We want to make sure to do this on top of a secure and compliant platform.

Through the comprehensive auditing process overseen by [Insight Assurance](https://insightassurance.com/), we've demonstrated our adherence
to the stringent requirements outlined by the SOC 2 Type 1 standard, reinforcing our dedication to safeguarding
sensitive data and maintaining operational resilience.

We're currently working on SOC2 Type 2 compliance, which we hope to have completed as soon as possible.
