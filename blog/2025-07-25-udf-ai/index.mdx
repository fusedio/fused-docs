# Launching udf.ai, AI built for data

Today we're announcing [udf.ai](https://udf.ai/), integrating AI directly into Fused.

import LazyReactPlayer from '@site/src/components/LazyReactPlayer'

<LazyReactPlayer 
    playsinline={true} 
    className="video__player" 
    loop={false} 
    playing={true}  
    muted={true} 
    controls 
    height="100%" 
    url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/blogs/udf_ai_weather_dashboard_compressed.mp4"
    width="100%" 
/>

## AI + Data + Runtime 

AI is an incredibly powerful tool, but prone to hallucinations and without context of your data.

So many AI tools being built help you _write_ code, not _run_ it.

We're not launching yet another AI Code Editor. We're see the potential to bring together:

- **[Incredibly fast code runtime](/core-concepts/write/)**: Just start writing code, it runs instantly.
- **[Fast AI integration](/workbench/ai-assistant/)**: We're constantly exploring the latest models for speed & effectiveness.
- **[Built on real data](/workbench/file-explorer/)**: Data questions are answered with real data, not hallucinations.

## What we're building

Fused has been building a real-time Python runtime for data teams for the past year.

At the same time, AI has made writing code so much simpler and faster, but executing it has been a major pain point.

We're building an integrated experience for teams handling data: Runtime, Data, and AI all in one place.

## A glimpse of the future

We're working on more giving AI more data context, for example asking:

> Make a dashboard with this data: s3://fused-asset/data/Substations.csv

Just like a data science would, our AI then:
- Read a sample of the data
- Understands the available columns
- Write Python code to parse the correct columns
- Creates a dashboard based on the most relevant data

<LazyReactPlayer 
    playsinline={true}
    className="video__player"
    playing={true}
    muted={true}
    controls
    height="100%"
    url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/blogs/dataset_dashboard.mp4"
    width="100%"
/>

We're building fast. Come back soon for more.
