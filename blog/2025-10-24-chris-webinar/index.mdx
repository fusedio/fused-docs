[Chris Kyed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-kyed-1388aa156/) works for [Pacific Spatial Solutions](https://www.pacificspatial.com/), a company that provides geospatial solutions for various industries in Japan. Last year Chris showcased how [Pacific Spatial uses Fused to analyze 100 Billion drive records](/blog/analyzing-traffic-speeds). Today Chris is showcasing more examples of how Fused is helping him to build analysis with large datasets:

### Ocean Health Mapping

River plumes carry nutrients/sediment to the ocean and are split in 2 broad categories:
- Good plume: natural sediment/nutrient redistribution/adds biodiversity
- Bad plume: excessive sediment/waste water and toxins/agricultural fertilizer

Mapping them can be helpful for understanding the health of the ocean and the impact of human activities on the ocean.

These datasets are open and available through the [Jaxa Earth API](https://data.earth.jaxa.jp/en/) :
- [Chlorophyll-a concentration (Daytime/Half-monthly)](https://data.earth.jaxa.jp/en/datasets/#/id/JAXA.G-Portal_GCOM-C.SGLI_standard.L3-CHLA.daytime.v3_global_half-monthly)
- [Sea surface temperature (Daytime/Half-monthly)](https://data.earth.jaxa.jp/en/datasets/#/id/JAXA.G-Portal_GCOM-C.SGLI_standard.L3-SST.daytime.v3_global_half-monthly)
- [Precipitation Rate (Half-monthly)](https://data.earth.jaxa.jp/en/datasets/#/id/JAXA.EORC_GSMaP_standard.Gauge.00Z-23Z.v6_half-monthly)


### Rainfall & Incidence Data

Traffic accidents and traffic safety has been one of the most important problems for the last many decades. Now that we have publicly accessible data regarding the accidents, we need to find ways to access and analyze it.

The Japanese National Police Agency published yearly traffic incidence data all around the country. 

- [Index of Open data on traffic accident statistics](https://www.npa.go.jp/publications/statistics/koutsuu/opendata/index_opendata.html)

### Tokyo Shadow Map

Japanese summers can get very hot, which is amplified in large urban areas creating urban heat islands. 

Prolonged exposure to the sun can cause dehydration and sunstroke, so we want to give Tokyo residents and tourists an app that can help them navigate the city in a more comfortable way.

Pacific Spatial Solutions is creating shadow maps for the city of Tokyo by combining 121 point clouds in batch and transforming them into 0.5m resolution DSM data and dynamically rendering them in Fused:
