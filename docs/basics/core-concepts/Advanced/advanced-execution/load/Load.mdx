You can seamlessly load UDFs from a local environment to Workbench, and vice versa.


## From local to Workbench

Begin by defining a UDF in a local Python environment. Then, upload it to your account's
cloud database with the `.to_fused` method. The UDF's name will be that of the function
name.


```python
# !pip install fused -q
```

```python
import fused

@fused.udf
def my_new_udf():
  import pandas as pd
  return pd.DataFrame({"b": [123]})
```

```python
# Verify successful execution
fused.run(udf=my_new_udf, engine='local')
```


|    |   b |
|---:|----:|
|  0 | 123 |

```python
# Upload the UDF to the cloud
my_new_udf.to_fused()
```

## From Workbench to local

Load a UDF saved in Workbench and run it in a local Python environment.

```python
import fused

loaded_udf = fused.load("plinio@fused.io/my_udf")
loaded_udf
```

```python
fused.run(udf=loaded_udf, engine='local')
```


## Save UDFs

UDFs are saved as a directory of associated files containing the UDF's code, utility modules, and metadata, and documentation. This section explains how to save UDFs and load UDFs.

For example, the following snippet when ran from Jupyter Notebook saves a UDF in a local directory, `Sample_UDF`.

```python
import fused

@fused.udf
def my_udf():
    return "Hello from Fused!"

# Save locally
my_udf.to_directory('Sample_UDF')
```

The directory contains the UDF's documentation, code, metadata, and utility function code.

```
└── Sample_UDF
    ├── README.MD
    ├── Sample_UDF.py
    ├── meta.json
    └── utils.py
```

Files relevant to each UDF are:

- `README.md` Provides details of the UDF's purpose and how it works.
- `Sample_UDF.py` This eponymous Python file contains the UDF's business logic as a Python function decorated with `@fused.udf`.
- `meta.json` This file contains metadata needed to render the UDF in the Fused explorer and for the UDF to run correctly.
- `utils.py` This Python file contains helper functions the UDF (optionally) imports and references.
