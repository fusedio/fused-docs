# Core modules

Core utility modules enhance the functionality and maintainability of UDFs.

As UDFs grow in complexity, it's useful to modularize the code to make it reusable and composable. It's also a good practice to keep only the essential "business logic" in the decorated UDF function - this makes it easy to know what a UDF does at a glance.

With this in mind, a Fused UDF can optionally reference a module to import Python objects from it, with an import statement as if importing from a Python package. These modules are reusable Python functions that promote code reuse and speed up development time. UDFs can import from a variety of sources: from the local environment, from GitHub, and from other UDFs. This section shows how to import modules into UDFs form each of these sources.

## From local

Local modules are Python files in the same environment as the UDF.


In the Workbench, the "module" code editor tab is the place for helper functions and other associated Python objects for the UDF to import. Keep in mind that the module's name is configurable in order to avoid naming collisions. In this example, UDF imports the function `arr_to_plasma` from its module, which is named `utils`. The function contains support logic the UDF uses it to transform an array.

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(bbox):
    from utils import arr_to_plasma
    ...
    return arr_to_plasma(arr.values, min_max=(0, .8))
```

When importing a module from a Python environment other than Workbench, the module must be specified as the locally-scoped file name in the `headers` argument of the `@fused.udf` decorator. This lets Fused know how to complete the reference.

```python
@fused.udf(
    headers=['utils.py']
)
def udf(bbox):
    from utils import arr_to_plasma
    ...
    return arr_to_plasma(arr.values, min_max=(0, .8))
```


## From GitHub

Fused UDFs can import utility modules from other UDFs. This enables the community and teams to share and reuse version controlled helper functions. Once a module is loaded, it can be used as a standard Python module to reference functions and objects using dot notation.

Load a UDF with [fused.load](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#load) then reference its utilities module. The utilities modules is referenced by its file name - in this example, the [file](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/blob/0dcc8/public/common/utils.py) is named `utils`, it's found within the UDF named `common`, and it contains the `table_to_tile` helper function. Notice how the commit sha `0dcc8` is included in the URL to ensure the UDF is loaded from a specific commit.


```python
my_utilities = fused.load(
    "https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/blob/0dcc8/public/common/"
    ).utils

my_utilities.table_to_tile(...)
```
