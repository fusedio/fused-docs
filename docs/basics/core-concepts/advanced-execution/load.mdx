UDFs can be loaded from GitHub repositories and from the Fused cloud. By referencing a remote UDF, you can call or fork it from anywhere without the need to copy the code. Fused also takes care of dependencies, ensuring smooth integration into your workflow. This is useful to enhance discoverability and reuse of code within your team and the wider community.

## Using `fused.load`

Load a UDF from a GitHub URL:
```py
udf = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/REM_with_HyRiver/")
```

Load a UDF using a Fused platform-specific identifier:
```py
udf = fused.load("username@fused.io/REM_with_HyRiver")
```
