<Tag color="#3399ff">Enterprise</Tag> _This feature is only accessible to organizations with a Fused Enterprise subscription._

Use Fused's built-in GitHub integration to load UDFs and helper functions directly from your team's private GitHub repository.

As you progress through this section, you'll benefit from learning how to [publish a UDF](/contribute/#publish-a-udf-to-a-github-repository) to your team's GitHub repository and how to [load modules](/basics/utilities/#from-github) from the repo into a new UDF.

You can configure one or multiple GitHub repositories for your organization - which means all accounts under that organization will have read access to the UDFs. UDFs will appear under the "Team UDFs" tab of the UDF explorer. Because those UDFs are read-only, users must first "duplicate" them in order to make changes.

:::info
At the moment, the GitHub integration is one-way. Fused can read from the GitHub repository. Managing UDFs in the repository involves direct interaction via git, as explained below.
:::

## Connect your GitHub repository

The Fused GitHub app places a webhook on the target repository that listens for changes to the `main` branch. When a change is detected, Fused scans the repository for UDFs and their helper functions, then loads them into the Workbench UDF explorer.

1. Create a repo where UDFs will be stored. There's no enforced repo structure because Fused will scan the entire repo for UDFs, although the [Public UDFs repo](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs) can serve as a guideline.

2. Install the Fused GitHub app for your organization. Navigate to [this GitHub URL](https://github.com/apps/fused-io), click "Configure", and select the GitHub organization that contains the repository.  

import gh2 from '@site/static/img/gh2.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={gh2} alt="File" style={{width: 400}} />
</div>

3. Scope the app to the target repository. It's recommended to select only the specific repo.

import gh3 from '@site/static/img/gh3.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={gh3} alt="File" style={{width: 400}} />
</div>


4. Once the above is complete, get in touch with the Fused team to enable the GitHub integration for your organization. 

5. Confirm the integration is enabled by checking the "Team UDFs" tab in the UDF explorer. UDFs from the GitHub repository will appear in the Workbench UDF explorer under the "Team UDFs" tab.
