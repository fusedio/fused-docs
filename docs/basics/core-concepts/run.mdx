All UDFs have secure HTTP endpoints callable via a [web request](/basics/core-concepts/run/#via-http-requests) or [`fused.run`](/basics/core-concepts/run/#fusedrun). An endpoint is accessed with a [shared token](/basics/core-concepts/run/#shared-token) or [private token](/basics/core-concepts/run/#private-token). You can [cache](/basics/core-concepts/run/#caching-responses) and [specify the type](/basics/core-concepts/run/#response-data-types) of the response.

## `fused.run`


The first argument of fused.run specifies the udf and the remaining inputs are passed to it. The UDF can be specified with a string identifier, shared token, or a UDF object. The UDF object can be defined in the code or loaded with `fused.load`.

### Ways to run a UDF

**With a public id.** This does not require authentication.

```python
fused.run('fsh_PC_File_Example')
```

**With a [shared token](/basics/core-concepts/run/#shared-token).** This does not require authentication and runs on the UDF account that owns the token. 

```python
fused.run('fsh_aJHN0awSfHLpYYinPSLYC')
```


**With a name and a private token.** This requires authentication and access to the UDF.

```python
fused.run("user@fused.io", "Overture_Maps")
```

**With GitHub and a private token.** Load the UDF from a GitHub repo. This requires authentication.


```python
udf = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/REM_with_HyRiver/")
fused.run(udf)
```

**With a UDF object.** Declare UDF then pass it to  udf object. This requires authentication unless the UDF is ran locally.

```python
@fused.udf
def my_udf():
    return ...
```

The UDF object can also be loaded from a user account using `fused.load`.  

```py
my_udf = fused.load("username@fused.io/REM_with_HyRiver")
```

Pass the UDF object to `fused.run` to execute the UDF.

```python
fused.run(my_udf)
```


### Execution engines

`fused.run` can run the UDF in various execution modes, as specified by the `engine` parameter either local, realtime, or batch mode. 
- `local`: Run in the current process. This is set by default.
- `realtime`: Run in the serverless Fused cloud engine.
- `batch`: Run in a server in the Fused cloud. Best for long-running jobs.

```python
fused.run(my_udf, engine="realtime")
```

Fused can also run UDFs asynchronously, which you can read more about [here](/basics/core-concepts/advanced-execution/async/).



## HTTP requests

In Workbench, you can create an HTTP endpoint for a UDF using the "Snippets" button located in the [UDF settings tab](/workbench/map-builder/udf-editor/#share--snippets). This button generates a unique URL to call the UDF via HTTP requests. The URL is scoped to that UDF only and, if necessary, it can be revoked to disable access. The same can be done with the [Fused Python SDK](/python-sdk/).




### Shared token

To run a UDF via HTTP request, generate a [signed UDF endpoint](/basics/core-concepts/#generate-endpoints-with-workbench) then modify the provided URL. 

Structure the URL with the `file` path parameter to run as a single batch operation.

```
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/******/run/file?dtype_out_raster=png
```

To integrate with a tiling service, structure the URL with the `tiles` path paramater, followed by templated `/{z}/{x}/{y}` path parameters. See [Lonboard](/basics/out/lonboard/) for an example.

```
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/******/run/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?dtype_out_raster=png
```

### Private token

Calling UDFs with [Bearer authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/) requires an account's [private token](/basics/utilities/#get-an-accounts-private-token). The URL structure to run UDFs with the private token varies slightly, as the URL specifies the UDF's name and the owner's user account. 

```bash
curl -XGET "https://app.fused.io/server/v1/realtime/fused/api/v1/run/udf/saved/user@fused.io/caltrain_live_location?dtype_out_raster=png" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Specify parameters

When UDF endpoints are called via HTTP requests argument values are specified with [query parameters](https://www.branch.io/glossary/query-parameters/), which require input parameters to be serializable. As such, the UDF should specify the types to cast them to. Read more about [supported types for UDF parameters](/python-sdk/#typing). 


### Response data types

The `dtype_out_vector` and `dtype_out_raster` parameters define the output data type for vector tables and raster arrays, respectively. 
- The supported types for table are `parquet`, `geojson`, `json`, `feather`, `csv`, `mvt`, `html`, `excel`, and `xml`. 
- For raster array: `png`, `gif`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `webp`, `tif`, and `tiff`.

```

```

Read how to structure HTTP endpoints to call the UDF as a [Map Tile & File](/basics/core-concepts/filetile/#http-endpoints).


## Caching responses
If enabled in the [UDF settings](/workbench/map-builder/udf-editor/#cache), UDF endpoints will cache outputs for each unique combination of code and parameters. The first call runs and caches the UDF and subsequent calls return the cache.
