Fused UDFs are Python functions that run in the cloud. They are the glue between your data and applications, and you can use them to build powerful workflows and apps to interact with any size dataset. Every UDF is can be shared as a map layer, called as an API endpoint, and deployed in an app.



You can write and run UDFs on the Fused Workbench browser IDE or in any Python environment using the Fused Python SDK.

As soon as you save a UDF Fused creates an API endpoint for it and, when an app calls the endpoint, Fused runs the UDF code on a serverless worker pool and returns the function output. Any tool in your stack can call a Fused UDF with a simple HTTP request to process and fetch data, which enables you to easily create reactive applications that integrate across your stack.

You can think of UDFs as building blocks to create workflows and integrations - without the devops or managing infrastructure. They integrate with your most important apps and can call each other (sequentially and in parallel) to assemble into complex workflows.



## todo
A UDF is a Python function that can easily be called via an API endpoint. It can easily be version controlled, shared, and reused across your workflows.
