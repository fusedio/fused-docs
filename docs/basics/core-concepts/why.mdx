Fused turns UDFs into shareable webapps and APIs. No devops required. 

- Run any Python via HTTP requests
- Process any size data
- Shared as a map, API endpoint, or app
- Reuse, share, and version control across your workflows
- Glue between your data and applications

As soon as you save a UDF Fused gives it an HTTP endpoint. When the endpoint is called, Fused runs the UDF code on a serverless worker pool and returns the function output. Any tool in your stack can call a Fused UDF with a simple HTTP request to process and fetch data, which enables you to easily create reactive applications that integrate across your stack.

Use UDFs as building blocks that abstract and modularize key operations that power your workflows and applications - without devops or managing infrastructure. They integrate with your most important apps and can call each other (sequentially and in parallel) to assemble into complex workflows.


You'll see how caching, composability, and flexible delivery make them particularly powerful.

## Caching: Virtual Datasets

Fused UDFs act like virtual datasets, similar to database views, without the need to materialize entire datasets. This is especially powerful for large-scale datasets, like geospatial. Instead of loading data to memory, which requires a big machine, UDFs define operations that run on a fraction of a dataset. This "lazy evaluation" strategy conserves resources for more flexible data handling - and has a natural synergy with cloud-optimized datasets and serverless architectures.

## Composability: Chained Operations

Modularization enables complex workflows from simple building-blocks. Create powerful, reusable analysis pipelines that process data on-demand, and call them from an HTTP endpoint with a single line of code.

## Flexible delivery: Type Your Output
Fused UDFs also excel in data delivery, offering various ways to export and share results. Integrate Fused workflows into broader data ecosystems and applications. UDFs return data:

- In common file formats for raster and vector table data (COGs, Parquet, GeoJSON, etc.)
- To create visualizations (maps, charts, etc.)
- To read and write data to cloud storage systems

By leveraging these three aspects - caching through virtual datasets, chaining of operations, and flexible delivery options - Fused UDFs provide a powerful framework to build scalable, efficient, and adaptable geospatial data processing systems. They enable teams to work with any size datasets without the need for extensive infrastructure.
