Fused is a data analytics platform to write and deploy Python functions behind HTTP endpoints and interactive applications. Fused runs your functions in a standardized execution environment.

## Highlights

- Bring fully-featured Python to any application
- Scale and parallelize with simple function calls
- Interactively explore, preview, and transform any size data
- Easily define, reuse, and share code snippets
- Reduce the need for devops and managing infrastructure
- *Express logic in Python and run at any scale
- *Encapsulate custom logic and utility functions within the UDF


## What is a UDF?

UDFs are Python "User Defined Functions" that can be called from anywhere to apply a specific operation to data. Out of the box, UDFs have an HTTP endpoint that can be called to run the function and return the output. This allows Fused to easily integrate with data applications and deliver data on-demand.

This diagram shows how UDFs link upstream datasets with downstream data platforms using standard Python libraries. 


UDFs are versatile building blocks to load and transform data across a range of use cases, including geospatial. They can be used as virtual datasets, file readers, and workflow tasks. 

## Virtual Datasets

UDFs can be used as virtual datasets, similar to database views, to deliver data behind an HTTP endpoint. They can return data in formats defined at call time based on the needs of the client application, such as COGs, Parquet, GeoJSON, etc. This eliminates the need to pre-process or transfer datasets ahead of time. 

## File Readers

UDFs can also be used to open files of different formats, like Parquet, CSV, and GeoJSON. This provides a standard interface to easily explore files in buckets and eliminates the need to move, copy, or transform entire datasets.

## Workflow Tasks

Multiple UDFs can be assembled to create complex workflows. They can serve as reusable tasks in analysis pipelines that process data on-demand.
