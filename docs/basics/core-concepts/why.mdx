Fused UDFs are reusable and modular Python functions that can run anywhere.

- [Run](/basics/core-concepts/run/) any Python via [HTTP requests](/basics/core-concepts/run/#http-requests)
- [Write](/basics/core-concepts/write/) your own UDFs or fork shared UDFs
- Process any size data
- Share as a map, API endpoint, or [app](/workbench/app-builder/)
- Reuse, share, and [version control](/basics/core-concepts/content-management/git/) UDFs across your workflows

This diagram shows how UDFs link upstream datasets with downstream data platforms using standard Python libraries. 



UDFs abstract key operations to power workflows and applications â€” without the need for devops or infrastructure management. 

When you save a UDF, Fused instantly generates an HTTP endpoint for it. Calling this endpoint triggers the UDF to run on a serverless worker pool, returning the output. Any tool in your stack can call a Fused UDF via a simple HTTP request, enabling reactive applications that seamlessly integrate across your stack.


Features like caching, the file explorer, composability, and flexible delivery make them particularly powerful.

## Caching: Virtual Datasets

Fused UDFs function as virtual datasets that interact with files without materialization - similar to database views. This is particularly advantageous for large-scale datasets, like geospatial. Rather than loading entire datasets into memory, which demands big machines, UDFs define operations that run on smaller portions of a dataset. This "lazy evaluation" strategy conserves resources, enabling more flexible data handling - and has a natural synergy with cloud-optimized datasets and serverless architectures.

## File Explorer: Streamlite Data Access

UDFs also function like reusable and composable readers for different file formats. The File Explorer can list, preview, and instantly create UDFs from objects in S3 buckets. This facilitates data discovery and exploration of cloud datasets, and eliminates the need without to move or copy entire datasets. 

## Composability: Reusable Operations

UDFs are composable building-blocks that can be assembled into complex workflows. They function as reusable tasks in analysis pipelines that process data on-demand. They run and load data across applications via simple HTTP requests. 

## Flexible Delivery: Type Your Output

UDFs can return data in formats defined at call time, dynamically determining the data type depending on what the client application requests. This eliminates the need to pre-process or transform datasets, and enables seamless adaptation. They support common file formats for raster and vector table data (COGs, Parquet, GeoJSON, etc.).


These 4 features make Fused UDFs a powerful framework to build simple, scalable, and adaptable data processing workflows.
