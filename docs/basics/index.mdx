# Meet Fused

⭐ Build and ship data apps in no time using [Fused Workbench](/workbench/overview/).

😎 [Write](/basics/core-concepts/write/) Python User Defined Functions ([UDFs](/basics/core-concepts/why/)) and [run](/basics/core-concepts/run/) them in your apps.

🤭 UDFs have batteries-included [HTTP endpoints](/basics/core-concepts/run/#http-requests) to create integrations.

⚽ Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BxS5wMzdRk) and [fork top UDFs](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main) to kickstart your next project.

## Why Fused?

Fused's most powerful feature is that UDFs run on the cloud when called via HTTP requests. This makes workflows and apps easy to scale, share, and seamlessly integrate.

Datasets and apps are growing in size and complexity. Traditional methods become increasingly impractical for the needs of industry. Serverless presents a much-needed solution. Fused moves and transforms any-size dataset across your most important tools. 

You can build and instantly share powerful workflows as apps and APIs.

This diagram shows how UDFs link upstream datasets with downstream data platforms using standard Python libraries.
