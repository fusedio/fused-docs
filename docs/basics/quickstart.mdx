description: Use HTTP Requests with Fused!

# Get started with Fused! üöÄ

Fused makes it easy to build and ship apps with any-size data. Fused UDFs are Python building blocks to fuse any data, with any tool, at any scale. 


- [Write](/basics/core-concepts/write/) UDFs in the Fused [Workbench](/workbench/overview/)
- [Run](/basics/core-concepts/run/) UDFs from your stack with [HTTP endpoints](/basics/core-concepts/run/#http-requests)
- Create and instantly share [Fused apps](/workbench/app-builder/) powered by UDFs
- Run UDFs in Jupyter notebooks with the [Python SDK](/python-sdk)

## Next steps

### Load a public UDF

To play with a more complex UDF, browse the UDF catalog and clone a UDF into your editor. A good beginner example is the "NSI Overture" UDF, which performs a [point-in-polygon](/basics/transform/geospatial/point-in-polygon/) operation between the NSI (National Structures Inventory) point and the Overture building footprints datasets. 

### Create an app

Create an app that runs your UDF in the [App builder](/workbench/app-builder/). Assemble the app with [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference) components, and share it with others by clicking the "Copy shareable link" button.


## What's next?

Congratulations, you're off to a great start with Fused. üéâ

- This quickstart is just the beginning
- Load data from [Google Earth Engine](/basics/in/gee/) and [DuckDB](/basics/in/duckdb/)
- Run operations like [buffer analysis](/basics/transform/geospatial/buffer/)
- Load data into [Lonboard](/basics/out/lonboard/) or [Streamlit](/basics/out/streamlit/), and [much more](/basics/tutorials/)
- Join [Discord](https://bit.ly/fused-discord) to connect with the community and discover what's possible
- Once you feel ready, [share your UDFs with the community](/python-sdk/contribute/)

Welcome aboard! üö¢
