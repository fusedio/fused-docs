description: Use HTTP Requests with Fused!
---

# Get started with Fused! 🚀

Fused makes it easy to build and ship apps with any-size data. Fused UDFs are Python building blocks to fuse any data, with any tool, at any scale. 


- [Write](/basics/core-concepts/write/) UDFs in the Fused [Workbench]((/workbench/overview/))
- [Run](/basics/core-concepts/run/) UDFs from your stack with [HTTP endpoints](/basics/core-concepts/run/#http-requests)
- Create and instantly share [Fused apps](/workbench/app-builder/) powered by UDFs
- Run UDFs in Jupyter notebooks with the [Python SDK](/python-sdk) 

## Workbench in 5 minutes ⏱️

This quickstart will guide you through writing your first UDF in the Fused Workbench and creating an app.

First, click [here](https://www.fused.io/workbench) to jump into the Fused UDF explorer follow the intro flow and log-in. 

### 1. Hello world

Click the "New UDF" button to open a template as a map layer. The UDF's output renders on the map and its print statements on the `results` section to give you instant feedback. The new UDF shows a basic tiled pattern on the map. 

import ImgQuickstart from '/img/image-101.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImgQuickstart} alt="File" style={{width: 600}} />
</div>

Acquaint yourself with the editor by typing in the code editor:
- Write a print statement such and see the output in the console
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
- Change the value of the `n` parameter to `42` see the pattern change based on UDF inputs

### 2. Load Census polygons

Now load U.S. Census polygons with [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/index.html). Copy this snippet and paste it to replace the UDF in your editor. It should create a `GeoDataFrame` with the census data, print the first rows of the dataset in the console, and display the data on the map.


```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import geopandas as gpd

    # Shape file as zip
    url = "https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/STATE/11_DISTRICT_OF_COLUMBIA/11/tl_rd22_11_bg.zip"
    gdf = gpd.read_file(url)
    print(gdf.head())
    return gdf
```


import ImageDCVector from '/img/dc_vector.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImageDCVector} alt="File" style={{width: '75%'}} />
</div>


Once data renders, navigate the map around Washington D.C.


### 3. Overlay Sentinel rasters

Finally, overlay Sentinel imagery on the map. Copy this snippet and paste it to replace the UDF. It loads Sentinel imagery, clips it to the census polygons, and display the result on the map.

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(
    bbox: fused.types.TileGDF = None, 
    time_of_interest: str = "2021-09-01/2021-12-30"
):
    import geopandas as gpd
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    # Shape file as zip
    gdf = gpd.read_file('https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/STATE/11_DISTRICT_OF_COLUMBIA/11/tl_rd22_11_tract.zip')

    # Tiles with intersecting geom
    gdf_clipped = gdf.dissolve().to_crs(4326).clip(bbox)
    gdf_w_bbox = pd.concat([gdf_clipped,bbox])

    # Load utility functions
    udf_sentinel = fused.load('https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/7b98f99/public/DC_AOI_Example/')

    # Read sentinel data
    arr = udf_sentinel.utils.get_arr(bbox, time_of_interest=time_of_interest, output_shape=(512,512))
    arr = np.clip(arr * 0.1, 0, 255).astype("uint8")[:3]
        
    # Create a geom mask
    geom_mask = fused.utils.common.gdf_to_mask_arr(gdf_w_bbox, arr.shape[-2:], first_n=1)    
    return np.ma.masked_array(arr, [geom_mask]*arr.shape[0])

```

import ImageDCRaster from '/img/dc_raster.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImageDCRaster} alt="File" style={{width: '75%'}} />
</div>

As a bonus, replace the `np.clip` line with this line to show NDVI.
```python
arr = udf_sentinel.utils.rgbi_to_ndvi(arr, colormap='RdYlGn', reverse=False)
```

Congratulations. You've just created a UDF that loads census polygons and layers-in Sentinel imagery. 🎉

## Next steps

### Load a public UDF

To play with a more complex UDF, browse the UDF catalog and clone a UDF into your editor. A good beginner example is the "NSI Overture" UDF, which performs a [point-in-polygon](/basics/transform/geospatial/point-in-polygon/) operation between the NSI (National Structures Inventory) point and the Overture building footprints datasets. 

### Create an app

Create an app that runs your UDF in the [App builder](/workbench/app-builder/). Assemble the app with [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference) components, and share it with others by clicking the "Copy shareable link" button.


## What's next?

Congratulations, you're off to a great start with Fused. 🎉

- This quickstart is just the beginning
