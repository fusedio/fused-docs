description: Use HTTP Requests with Fused!

# Get started with Fused! üöÄ

Fused makes it easy to build and ship apps with any-size data. Fused UDFs are building blocks to fuse any data, with any tool, at any scale. You write and run UDFs in the Fused Workbench then:

- Integrate UDFs into your stack with [HTTP endpoints](/basics/core-concepts/call/#create-a-udf-endpoint)
- Create and instantly share [Fused apps](/workbench/app-builder/) powered by UDFs
- Run UDFs in Jupyter notebooks with the[Python SDK](/python-sdk) 

## Workbench in 5 minutes ‚è±Ô∏è

This quickstart will guide you through writing your first UDF in the Fused Workbench and creating an app.

First, click [here](https://www.fused.io/workbench) to jump into the Fused UDF explorer follow the intro flow and log-in. 

### 1. Hello world

Click the "New UDF" button to open a template as a map layer. The UDF's output renders on the map and its print statements on the `results` section to give you instant feedback. The new UDF shows a basic tiled pattern on the map.

Acquaint yourself with the editor by typing in the code editor:
- Write a print statement such and see the output in the console
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
- Change the value of the `n` parameter to see the pattern change based on UDF inputs

### 2. Load Census polygons

Now load U.S. Census polygons with [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/index.html). Copy this snippet and paste it to replace the UDF in your editor. It should create a `GeoDataFrame` with the census data, print the first rows of the dataset in the console, and display the data on the map.


```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import geopandas as gpd

    # Shape file as zip
    url = "https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/STATE/11_DISTRICT_OF_COLUMBIA/11/tl_rd22_11_bg.zip"
    gdf = gpd.read_file(url)
    print(gdf.head())
    return gdf
```


import ImageAnatomy from '/img/udfanatomy.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImageAnatomy} alt="File" style={{}} />
</div>


Once data renders, navigate the map around Washington D.C.


### 3. Overlay Sentinel rasters

Finally, overlay Sentinel imagery on the map. Copy this snippet and paste it to replace the UDF.. It loads Sentinel imagery, clips it to the census polygons, and display the result on the map.

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(
    bbox: fused.types.TileGDF=None, 
    time_of_interest="2021-09-01/2021-12-30", 
    ndvi=False
):
    import geopandas as gpd
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    # Shape file as zip
    gdf = gpd.read_file('https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/STATE/11_DISTRICT_OF_COLUMBIA/11/tl_rd22_11_tract.zip')

    # Tiles with intersecting geom
    gdf_clipped = gdf.dissolve().to_crs(4326).clip(bbox)
    gdf_w_bbox = pd.concat([gdf_clipped,bbox])

    # Load utility functions
    udf_sentinel = fused.load('https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/7b98f99/public/DC_AOI_Example/')

    # Read sentinel data
    arr = udf_sentinel.utils.get_arr(bbox, time_of_interest=time_of_interest, output_shape=(512,512))
    arr = np.clip(arr *  0.1, 0, 255).astype("uint8")[:3]
        
    # Create a geom mask
    geom_mask = fused.utils.common.gdf_to_mask_arr(gdf_w_bbox, arr.shape[-2:], first_n=1)    
    return np.ma.masked_array(arr, [geom_mask]*arr.shape[0])

```

As a bonus, replace the `np.clip` line with this line to show NDVI:
```python
arr = udf_sentinel.utils.rgbi_to_ndvi(arr, colormap='RdYlGn', reverse=False)
```

Congratulations. You've just created a UDF that loads census polygons and layers-in Sentinel imagery. üéâ

## Next steps

### Load a public UDF

To play with a more complex UDF, browse the UDF catalog and clone a UDF into your editor. A good beginner example is the "NSI Overture" UDF, which performs a [point-in-polygon](/basics/transform/geospatial/point-in-polygon/) operation between the NSI (National Structures Inventory) point and the Overture building footprints datasets. 

### Create an app

Now that you have a UDF you're happy with, you can create an app to interact with it. Copy the UDF's token and navigate to the "App builder". You can customize the app's appearance and behavior with the [Streamlit Python API](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference), and share it with others by clicking the "Copy shareable link" button.


## What's next?

Congratulations! You're off to a great start with Fused. üéâ

With Fused you can do much more than what has been introduced so far, from loading data
from [Google Earth Engine](/basics/in/gee/) and [DuckDB](/basics/in/duckdb/), operations
like [buffer analysis](/basics/transform/geospatial/buffer/), to exporting data into [Lonboard](/basics/out/lonboard/) or [Streamlit](/basics/out/streamlit/), and [much more](/basics/tutorials/). Head over to
the [Python SDK documentation](/python-sdk/) to learn more about what's possible and
join the community on [Discord](https://bit.ly/fused-discord).

Once you feel ready, we invite you to [share the UDFs you create with the community](/python-sdk/contribute/)!

Welcome aboard! üö¢

###############
- overview: make bullet points shorter than 1 line, and single sentence. change emojis to not have blank background.
  - bullet: 
    - Build and ship data apps in no time using Fused.
    - write and run. a modularized udf.
    - out-of-box api should link to HTTP on run page
    - vibrant community (discord) and public udfs (github)
    - 
  - nuke patterns section


- as if it's a merfo af write udf and run udf, and remove other stuff .don't mention tilefile nor http.
- ok if example, as code that can be copypastable on workbench, is long. must have parameters. 
- caching
- what's a udf and convince me why it's great
- be concise and single page, almost no scroll, link to other pages (write udf and run udf)
