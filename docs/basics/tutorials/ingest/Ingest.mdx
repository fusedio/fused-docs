# How-to: Ingestion

This example notebook shows how to use Fused to ingest data into an S3 bucket.

## Ingest data

Fused delivers speed advantages thanks to spatial partitioning. Geospatial operations
between two or more datasets are usually for spatially overlapping or neighboring areas
\- and usually for localized areas of interest. Breaking down datasets across geographic
chunks loads only the relevant data for each operation.

The [`fused.ingest()`](/python-sdk/api/top-level-functions/#fused.ingest) method loads
data into an S3 bucket and automatically geo partitions it.

Datasets ingested with Fused are spatially partitioned collections of Parquet files.
Each file has one or more chunks, which are a further level of spatial partitioning.

Columns in a dataset are grouped into tables. An ingested dataset contains a `main`
table with the original input columns and a `fused` table containing spatial metadata.

The `ingest()` method has many configuration options, which the API documentation
explains. The following sections cover a few different ingestion use cases.

Pro tip: While Fused is generally used to ingest files, it's also possible to pass the
`GeoDataFrame` directly to `fused.ingest()`.

### Default ingestion

By default ingestion tries to create a certain number of files (`target_num_files=20`).
The number of rows per file and chunk are chosen to meet this target. Note that 20 files
is only a target and the actual number of files generated can vary.

```python
import fused


job = fused.ingest(
    input="https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/LAYER/TRACT/tl_rd22_11_tract.zip",
    output=f"fd://census/dc_tract",
)
job_id = job.run_remote(overwrite=True)
```

While the job is running, follow its logs.

```python
job_id.tail_logs()
```

### Row-based ingestion

Our basic ingestion is row-based, where the user set the maximum number of rows per each
chunk and file.

```python
job = fused.ingest(
    input="https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/LAYER/TRACT/tl_rd22_11_tract.zip",
    explode_geometries=True,
    partitioning_method="rows",
    partitioning_maximum_per_file=100,
    partitioning_maximum_per_chunk=10,
)
job_id = job.run_remote(overwrite=True)
```

### Area-based ingestion

Fused also supports area-based ingestion, where the number of rows in each partition is
determined by the sum of their area.

```python
job = fused.ingest(
    input="https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/LAYER/TRACT/tl_rd22_11_tract.zip",
    output=f"fd://census/dc_tract_area",
    explode_geometries=True,
    partitioning_method="area",
    partitioning_maximum_per_file=None,
    partitioning_maximum_per_chunk=None,
)
job_id = job.run_remote(overwrite=True)
```

### Geometry subdivision

It's also possible to subdivide geometries in the ingestion process.

```python
job = fused.ingest(
    input="https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/LAYER/TRACT/tl_rd22_11_tract.zip",
    output=f"fd://census/dc_tract_geometry",
    explode_geometries=True,
    partitioning_method="area",
    partitioning_maximum_per_file=None,
    partitioning_maximum_per_chunk=None,
    subdivide_start=0.001,
    subdivide_stop=0.0001,
    subdivide_method="area",
)
job_id = job.run_remote(overwrite=True)
```

Once ingestion completes,
[`fused.open_table`](/python-sdk/api/experimental/#fused._experimental.open_table)
returns the corresponding [`Table`](/python-sdk/api/experimental/#fused.models.Table)
object.

The notebook _repr_ provides insight into the Table structure.

- Each table has one or more _files_, which are spatially partitioned.
- Each file has one or more _chunks_, which are again spatially partitioned within the
  file.

Optionally, tables can be part of a `Dataset`, which consists of one or more _tables_.

```python
census_tracts = fused.open_table(f"fd://census/dc_tract")
census_tracts
```
