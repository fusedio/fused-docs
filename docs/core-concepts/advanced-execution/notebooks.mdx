To use the Fused [Python SDK](/python-sdk/) in a Python Notebook, you'll need to authenticate.

Start by installing [`fused-py`](https://pypi.org/project/fused/).

```python showLineNumbers
# !pip install fused -q
```

When running Fused in a Notebook, you might be prompted to authenticate. Call [NotebookCredentials](/reference/fused/api/credentials/) in a cell.

```python showLineNumbers
from fused import NotebookCredentials

credentials = NotebookCredentials()
```

Complete the authentication flow and paste the provided credentials snippet in a new cell.

```
credentials.finalize(code="...")
```

Fused will write credentials to disk (in `~/.fused/credentials`) and `fused-py` will have access to the Fused API.

:::info
When running code from a Python environment without browser access, you may copy the `~/.fused/credentials` file to the same location in the target system.
