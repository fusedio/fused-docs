{/* TODO: 
Intro concept of caching in Fused: Goal of FUsed is to make developing & running faster. Caching can be a smart way to make recurring requests more responsive
Fused has 2 main cache types:
- `@fused.cache` decorator
    - Demonstrate (probably in notebook)
    - Show how to use
    - Explain *when* someone would want to use it (it's not always helpful)
        - Incredibly helpful for making workbench more responsive: query data 1 time and then make operations on it
        - Can be used as "1 time ingestion" for non partioned files
    - Mention limits
        - 24h limit
        - Changes on each code or input change, so quite brittle
- UDF caching 
    - Demonstrate (also in notebook probably: call same UDF 1 first time, then make same call again -> Should be faster)
    - Explain when this is helpful
        - Show in workbench toggle to turn this on: UDF Builder -> Settings -> Share (on by default)
        - In code somewhere?
*/}

Caching stores the result of slow function calls so they only need to run once. This persists objects across reruns and makes UDFs faster.

### Basic

To cache a function decorate it with `@fused.cache`.

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd

    @fused.cache
    def load_data(i):
        return pd.DataFrame({'id': [i]})

    df_first = load_data(i=1)
    df_second = load_data(i=2)
    return pd.concat([df_first, df_second])
```

The first time Fused sees the function code and parameters, Fused runs the function and stores the return value in a cache. The next time the function is called with the same parameters and code, Fused skips running the function and returns the cached value.
### Advanced


Pass [`bbox`](/core-concepts/filetile/#the-bbox-object) to make the output unique to each [Tile](/core-concepts/filetile/#tile).


```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bbox: fused.types.TileGDF=None):

    @fused.cache
    def fn(bbox):
        return bbox

    return fn(bbox)
```


Set a custom cache directory with the optional `path` parameter.

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd

    @fused.cache(path='optional_cache_dir')
    def fn():
        return pd.DataFrame()

    return fn()
```



Reset the cache by running the function once with `reset=True`.

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd

    @fused.cache(reset=True)
    def fn():
        return pd.DataFrame()

    return fn()
```
