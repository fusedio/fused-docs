Download remote files to the local system to make them available to UDFs across runs. Files are written to a [disk](/core-concepts/content-management/file-system/#mntcache-disk) shared across all UDFs in an organization.

## `fused.download`

Call [`fused.download`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#download) with the file's endpoint in the `url` parameter and the local file name in the `file_path` parameter. The function will download the file and return the file path, which functions can reference.

This example downloads a `.zip` file then returs it as a `GeoDataFrame`. 

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(url='https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/STATE/11_DISTRICT_OF_COLUMBIA/11/tl_rd22_11_bg.zip'):
    import fused
    import geopandas as gpd

    # Download zip file
    out_path = fused.download(url=url, file_path='out.zip')

    # Show path to file
    print(out_path)

    return gpd.read_file(out_path)
```

:::info
The `download` function sets a lock during the first download attempt, to ensure the download happens only once. This is useful for Tile execution.
