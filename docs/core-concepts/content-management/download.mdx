The [`fused.download` utility function](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#download) downloads files from remote endpoints to the local mounted filesystem. This is useful to make a file accessible from a local path to a single UDF across runs or to several UDFs - without needing to re-download it each time.

:::info
Downloaded files are written to a mounted volume shared across all UDFs in an organization. This means that a file downloaded by one UDF can be read by other UDFs.
:::


## Example: download `.zip` file

To download a file to disk, call `fused.download` with the remote file endpoint in the `udf` parameter and the local file name in the `file_path` parameter. The function will download the file only and return the file path, which downstream functions can reference.

This example downloads a `.zip` file then returs it as a GeoDataFrame. Note how GeoPandas reads the local file path returned by `download`.

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(url='https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/STATE/11_DISTRICT_OF_COLUMBIA/11/tl_rd22_11_bg.zip'):
    import fused
    import geopandas as gpd

    # Download zip file
    out_path = fused.download(url=url, file_path='out.zip')

    # Show path to file
    print(out_path)

    return gpd.read_file(out_path)
```

:::info
Because a Tile UDF runs multiple chunks in parallel, the `download` function sets a lock during the first download attempt, to ensure the download happens only once.
