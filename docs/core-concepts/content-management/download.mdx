# Download

Download remote files to the local system to make them available to UDFs across runs. Files are written to a [disk](/core-concepts/content-management/file-system/#mntcache-disk) shared across all UDFs in an organization.

## [`fused.download`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fuseddownload)

Download any file to: `/mount/tmp/` which any other UDF can then access.


```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(url='https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/STATE/11_DISTRICT_OF_COLUMBIA/11/tl_rd22_11_bg.zip'):
    out_path = fused.download(url=url, file_path='out.zip')
    print(out_path)
```

:::info
The `download` function sets a lock to ensure the download happens only once, in case the UDF is called concurrently.
