Is there a way to set environment variables or secrets/API keys?

Save constants to an `.env` file to make them available to UDFs as environment variables. You should use the [secrets manager](/workbench/configuration/#secrets-management) for sensitive information like API keys.

First, run a [File UDF](/core-concepts/filetile/#single-file) that sets variables in an `.env` file in the [`/mnt/cache/` directory](/core-concepts/content-management/file-system/#mntcache-disk).

```py
@fused.udf
def udf():
    env_vars = """
    MY_ENV_VAR=123
    """

    # Path to .env file in disk file system
    env_file_path = '/mnt/cache/.env'

    # Write the environment variables to the .env file
    with open(env_file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(env_vars)
```

Now, any UDF can load the values from `.env` as environment variables with the [`load_dotenv`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) and access them with [os.getenv](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-os-getenv-method/).

```py
@fused.udf
def udf():
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # Load environment variable
    env_file_path = '/mnt/cache/.env'
    load_dotenv(env_file_path, override=True)

    # Access environment variable
    print(f"Updated MY_ENV_VAR: {os.getenv('MY_ENV_VAR')}")
```
