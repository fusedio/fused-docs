You may save constants and secrets to an `.env` file to make them available to your UDFs via environment variables.

To do this, first run a UDF that sets variables in an `.env` file then run a different UDF that loads the variables into the environment using the [`dotenv` library](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/).

:::note
To be accessible to all UDF run events, the file must be placed on the runtime's mount path `/mnt/cache/`.
:::

```py
@fused.udf
def udf():
    env_vars = """
    MY_ENV_VAR=123
    DB_USER=username
    DB_PASS=******
    """

    # Path to .env file in disk file system
    env_file_path = '/mnt/cache/.env'

    # Write the environment variables to the .env file
    with open(env_file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(env_vars)
```

Then, in a different UDF, load the variables into the environment.

```py
@fused.udf
def udf():
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # Load environment variable
    env_file_path = '/mnt/cache/.env'
    load_dotenv(env_file_path, override=True)
    print(f"Updated MY_ENV_VAR: {os.getenv('MY_ENV_VAR')}")
```
