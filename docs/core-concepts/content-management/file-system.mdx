Fused gives you two file systems to store files and make them accessible to all UDFs: an S3 bucket and a disk. Access is scoped at the organization level.

## `fd://` S3 bucket

Fused provisions an S3 bucket namespace for each organization. Use the [File explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/) to browse the bucket and see its full path. It's ideal for large-scale, cloud-native, or globally accessible datasets, such as ingested tables, GeoTIFFs, and files that need to be read outside of Fused.

In this image, for example, the bucket path `s3://fused-users/fused/plinio/dir-name/file.parquet` is conveniently aliased as `fd://dir-name/file.parquet`.


import ImageCm from '@site/static/img/image-cm.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImageCm} alt="File" style={{width: '100%'}} />
</div>


Fused utility functions may reference it with the `fd://` alias. For example, to ingest a table:
```python
job = fused.ingest(
    input="https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/STATE/06_CALIFORNIA/06/tl_rd22_06_bg.zip",
    output="fd://census/ca_bg_2022/",
).run_remote()
```


## `/mnt/cache` disk

`/mnt/cache` is a mounted disk to store files shared between UDFs. In fact, it's where [`@fused.cache`](/basics/core-concepts/write/#fusedcache-decorator) and `fused.download` write data. It's ideal when UDFs need low-latency reads for files such as downloaded files, the output of cached functions, access keys, `.env`, and ML model weights.

UDFs may interact with the disk as with a local file system. For example, to list files in the directory:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import os

    for each in os.listdir('/mnt/cache/'):
        print(each)
```
