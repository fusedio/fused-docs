Github integration allows you to:
- Commit your code to Fused [public](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public) & [community](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/community) repositories for [anyone to use](https://www.fused.io/workbench/udf/catalog?tab=community)!
- Saving & Versioning of UDFs
- Collaboration across teams (for Professional users)

## Connecting your own repositories

<Tag color="#3399ff">Professional and Enterprise</Tag> _Integrating private repositories is accessible to organizations with a Fused Professional & Enterprise subscription (see [Plans](https://www.fused.io/pricing))._

Fused Github integration plugs directly into your own repositories.

### Configuring Github integration


1. Create a new [Github repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository). There's no enforced repo structure because Fused scans the entire repo for UDFs, although the [Public UDFs repo](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs) may serve as guideline.

2. Install the Fused GitHub app for your organization. Navigate to [this GitHub URL](https://github.com/apps/fused-io), click "Configure", and select the GitHub organization that contains the repository.

3. Scope the app to the target repository. It's recommended to select only the specific repo.

4. Once the above is complete, please reach out to the Fused team to finish setup (`info@fused.io`):
- Provide Fused team with your Github path & name: `some-organization/some-repo`. (Example: `fusedio/udfs`)

5. Confirm the integration is enabled by checking that repo UDFs appear under the "Team UDFs" tab in the UDF Catalog.

You can see all the repositories you have access to in the Versions Tab:
