# Data Ingestion

_This page will give you all the tools to make your data fast to read to make your UDFs more responsive._

{/*
Topics:
- Why do we need to do ingestion?
    - Cloud native
    - But also partitioned correctly
- How to do this ingestion?
    - Running `job = fused.ingest()` + `job.run_remote()`
- When is this needed
    - There's a section in the FAQ about when to ingest or not. This should be addressed in the ingestion page instead. 
- What happens after?

## What is this page about?

The whole purpose of Fused is to speed up data science pipelines. 
To make this happen we need the data we're working with to be responsive, regardless of the dataset. The ideal solution is to have all of our data sitting in RAM right next to our compute, but in real-world applications:
- Datasets especially geospatial data can be in the Tb or Pb range not even fitting in storage, let alone RAM
- Compute needs to be scaled up and down depending on workloads.

One solution to this is to build data around **Cloud Optimized formats**: Data lives in the cloud but is also formatted in ways making it fast to access. Just putting a `.zip` file than needs to be uncompressed every time on an S3 bucket still makes reading it very slow.

(Re-use info from FAQ page)
Topics:
- If small file (<100Mb), read only once and in a format that's fast to load, than don't need
- If large file, not in cloud, will be read more than once every seconds, doesn't fit in memory, then you would be better off ingesting your data
- Applies to both vector & raster data (also re-use section on "why partition vector tables?")

Topics:
- Don't have to use Fused, but we provide a handy way of making your data into cloud-native geo-partitioned data
- Demo how to do it
