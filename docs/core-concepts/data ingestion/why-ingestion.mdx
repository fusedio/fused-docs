# Data Ingestion

_This page will give you all the tools to make your data fast to read to make your UDFs more responsive._

{/*
Topics:
- Why do we need to do ingestion?
    - Cloud native
    - But also partitioned correctly
- How to do this ingestion?
    - Running `job = fused.ingest()` + `job.run_remote()`
- When is this needed
    - There's a section in the FAQ about when to ingest or not. This should be addressed in the ingestion page instead. 
- What happens after?

## What is this page about?

The whole purpose of Fused is to speed up data science pipelines. 
To make this happen we need the data we're working with to be responsive, regardless of the dataset. The ideal solution is to have all of our data sitting in RAM right next to our compute, but in real-world applications:
- Datasets (especially geospatial data) can be in the Tb or Pb range which can't fit in storage, let alone RAM
- Compute needs to be scaled up and down depending on workloads.

One solution to this is to build data around **Cloud Optimized formats**: Data lives in the cloud but also leverages file formats that are fast to access. Just putting a `.zip` file than needs to be uncompressed every time on an S3 bucket still makes reading it very slow. Our ingested data should be:
- **On the cloud** so dataset size doesn't matter (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.)
- **Partitioned** (broken down into smaller pieces that are fast to retrieve so we can load only sections of the dataset we need)

This makes it fast to read for any UDF (and any other cloud operation), so developing UDFs in [Workbench UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) & [running UDFs](/core-concepts/run-udfs/) is a lot faster & responsive!

## File Formats

### For rasters (images)

For images (like satellite images) we recommend using **Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs** (COGs). To paraphrase [the Cloud Native Geo guide on them](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/cloud-optimized-geotiffs/intro.html):

> Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG), a raster format, is a variant of the TIFF image format that specifies a particular layout of internal data in the GeoTIFF specification to allow for optimized (subsetted or aggregated) access over a network for display or data reading

:::warning
    Fused does not (yet) have a build-in tool to ingest raster data. We suggest you create COGs yourself, for example by using `gdal`'s [built-in options](https://gdal.org/en/stable/drivers/raster/cog.html#examples) or [`cogger`](https://github.com/airbusgeo/cogger?tab=readme-ov-file#usage)
    {/* TODO: Link to how to run CLI commands in Fused once we have this up and running */}
:::

Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs have multiple different features making them particularly interesting for cloud native applications, namely:
- **Tiling**: Images are split into smaller tiles that can be individually accessed, making getting only parts of data a lot faster.
- **Overviews**: Pre-rendered images of lower zoom levels of images. This makes displaying images at different zoom levels a lot faster

### For vectors (tables)

To handle vector data such as `pandas` `DataFrames` or `geopandas` `GeoDataFrames` we recommend using **[GeoParquet](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet)** files. To (once again) paraphrase the [Cloud Native Geo guide](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/geoparquet/):

> GeoParquet is an encoding for how to store geospatial vector data (point, lines, polygons) in Apache Parquet, a popular columnar storage format for tabular data.

{/* NOTE: This might be better in next page ## When do you need to ingest your data? */}
{/* 
(Re-use info from FAQ page)
Topics:
- If small file (<100Mb), read only once and in a format that's fast to load, than don't need
- If large file, not in cloud, will be read more than once every seconds, doesn't fit in memory, then you would be better off ingesting your data
- Applies to both vector & raster data (also re-use section on "why partition vector tables?")
