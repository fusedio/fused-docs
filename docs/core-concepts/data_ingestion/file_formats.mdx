# File Formats

_This page specifies which File Formats for both raster & vector data we prefer working with at Fused, and why_

### For rasters (images)

For images (like satellite images) we recommend using **Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs** (COGs). To paraphrase [the Cloud Native Geo guide on them](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/cloud-optimized-geotiffs/intro.html):

> Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG), a raster format, is a variant of the TIFF image format that specifies a particular layout of internal data in the GeoTIFF specification to allow for optimized (subsetted or aggregated) access over a network for display or data reading

:::warning
    Fused does not (yet) have a build-in tool to ingest raster data. We suggest you create COGs yourself, for example by using `gdal`'s [built-in options](https://gdal.org/en/stable/drivers/raster/cog.html#examples) or [`rio-cogeo`](https://cogeotiff.github.io/rio-cogeo/)
    {/* TODO: Link to how to run CLI commands in Fused once we have this up and running */}
:::

Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs have multiple different features making them particularly interesting for cloud native applications, namely:
- **Tiling**: Images are split into smaller tiles that can be individually accessed, making getting only parts of data a lot faster.
- **Overviews**: Pre-rendered images of lower zoom levels of images. This makes displaying images at different zoom levels a lot faster

### For vectors (tables)

To handle vector data such as `pandas` `DataFrames` or `geopandas` `GeoDataFrames` we recommend using **[GeoParquet](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet)** files. To (once again) paraphrase the [Cloud Native Geo guide](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/geoparquet/):

> GeoParquet is an encoding for how to store geospatial vector data (point, lines, polygons) in Apache Parquet, a popular columnar storage format for tabular data.

import ImgGeoParquet from '@site/docs/user-guide/examples/geoparquet_overview.png';
