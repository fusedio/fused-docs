## General questions

### Whom is Fused for?

Fused is designed for teams seeking to simplify their workflows and accelerate the creation and delivery of data products. It's ideal for organizations that need a scalable solution to handle growing data sizes while minimizing the time spent on data engineering.

### Why Python, when there's spatial SQL?
Python is the go-to language for spatial data science. Although spatial SQL joins and transformations can be efficiently performed using PostGIS in an external database, you may eventually need to convert that data to Pandas and NumPy for further processing and analysis, especially for detailed operations on raster arrays. Additionally, you can run SQL directly on Fused using Python libraries like DuckDB, combining the strengths of both approaches.


### What does Fused's GeoParquet partitioning enable?

It enables efficient reading of large datasets by strategically partitioning GeoParquet files. Fused's GeoParquet format includes metadata that allows for spatial filtering of any dataset, loading only the chunks relevant to a specific area of interest. This approach reduces memory usage and allows you to work with large datasets using just Python.

### When should I ingest a file vs. load it as is?

You should ingest a file if it has a spatial component and you plan to visualize it or use it for downstream analysis. Ingesting allows for more efficient and lightweight repeated access. On the other hand, if the file is small (under 100 MB), fits into memory, and is intended for a one-off operation, you should load it as is. This approach avoids the overhead of ingestion for single-use or infrequent access scenarios.





## Troubleshooting


### Error: 'Quota limit: Number of running instances'

Fused batch operations, such as ingestion, require a server quota to be enabled for your account. If you encounter this error, please contact the Fused team to request an increase in the quota allotted to your account.
