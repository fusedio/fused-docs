# Map Tile/File

When UDFs are called, they [run](/core-concepts/run-udfs/) and return the output of the execution. They can be called in two ways that influence how Fused handles them: `File` and `Tile`.

### Single File

In `File` mode, the UDF runs within a single HTTP response. This is suitable for tasks that can be completed in a single request, such as processing data that fits in memory.

import ImageFile from '@site/static/img/image-file2.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImageFile} alt="File" style={{width: 600,}} />
</div>

### Map Tiles

`Tile` mode is designed to process geospatial datasets in grid-based tiles that align with [web map tiling schemas](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map). Each Tile request may correspond to a spatial slice of a larger dataset, making it ideal to work with large datasets that can be spatially filtered.

When a UDF endpoint is called as `Tile`, Fused passes `bounds` as the first argument, which the UDF can use to spatially filter the dataset. The [`bounds` object](/core-concepts/filetile/#bounds-object-types) specifies a tile by its bounds or XYZ index.

import ImageTile from '@site/static/img/image-tile2.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImageTile} alt="File" style={{width: 600}} />
</div>

This is in contrast with a `File` call, where the UDF runs within a single HTTP response. In `File` mode, the UDF doesn't receive a `bounds` object to spatially filter data into tiles.

Responses with spatial data can render on a map. `GeoDataFrames` already contain spatial geometry information. If a raster does not contain spatial information, the bounds must be specified alongside the output object, separated by a comma, to determine its location on a map.

```python showLineNumbers
return arr, [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]
```

## The `bounds` object

A UDF may use the `bounds` parameter to spatially filter datasets and load into memory only the data that corresponds to the `bounds` spatial bounds. This reduces latency and data transfer costs.
[Cloud-optimized formats](/core-concepts/data-ingestion/file-formats/) are particularly suited for these operations - they include [Cloud Optimized GeoTiff](https://www.cogeo.org/), [Geoparquet](https://geoparquet.org/), and [GeoArrow](https://geoarrow.org/format.html).

### `bounds` object types

The `bounds` object defines the spatial bounds of the Tile, which can be represented as a geometry object or XYZ index.

#### `fused.types.Tile`

This is a [geopandas.GeoDataFrame](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.html) with `x`, `y`, `z`, and `geometry` columns.

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bounds: fused.types.Tile=None):
    print(bounds)

>>>      x    y   z                                           geometry
>>> 0  327  790  11  POLYGON ((-122.0 37.0, -122.0 37.1, -122.1 37.1, -122.1 37.0, -122.0 37.0))
```

#### `fused.types.Bounds`

This is a `list` of 4 points representing the bounds (extent) of a geometry. The 4 points represent `[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]` of the bounds.

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bounds: fused.types.Bounds=None):
    print(bounds)

>>> [-1.52244399, 48.62747869, -1.50004107, 48.64359255]
```

:::note
As `fused.types.Bounds` is a list of 4 points it cannot be returned in a UDF directly. The simplest way to return it is to convert it to a `GeoDataFrame`:

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bounds: fused.types.Bounds=None):
    import shapely
    import geopandas as gpd
    utils = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/eda5aec/public/common/").utils
    bounds = utils.bounds_to_gdf(bounds)
    print(bounds)
    return bounds
```

`fused` also comes with many [handy utils functions](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/blob/58288bff7b5f34bff100b24b0edd226cbada4970/public/common/utils.py#L1891) that allow you to quickly access these common operations:

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bounds: fused.types.Bounds=None):
    utils = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/eda5aec/public/common/").utils
    bounds = utils.bounds_to_gdf(bounds)
    return bounds
```

### Legacy types

These types are still currently supported in `fused` though only for legacy reasons and will soon be deprecated.

{/* #### `fused.types.Bbox`

This is a [shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.Polygon.html) corresponding to the Tile's bounds.

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bbox: fused.types.Bbox=None):
    print(bbox)
    return bbox

>>> POLYGON ((-122.0 37.0, -122.0 37.1, -122.1 37.1, -122.1 37.0, -122.0 37.0))
```

#### `fused.types.TileXYZ`

This is a [mercantile.Tile](https://mercantile.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/mercantile.html) object with values for the `x`, `y`, and `z` Tile indices.

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bbox: fused.types.TileXYZ=None):
    print(bbox)
    return bbox

>>> Tile(x=328, y=790, z=11)
``` */}

#### [Legacy] `fused.types.TileGDF`

This behaves the same as [`fused.types.Tile`](/core-concepts/filetile/#fusedtypestile).

#### [Legacy] `fused.types.ViewportGDF`

This is a [geopandas.geodataframe.GeoDataFrame](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.html) with a `geometry` column corresponding to the coordinates of the current viewport in the Map.
```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bbox: fused.types.ViewportGDF=None):
    print(bbox)
    return bbox

>>>  geometry
>>>  POLYGON ((-122.0 37.0, -122.0 37.1, -122.1 37.1, -122.1 37.0, -122.0 37.0))
```

#### [Legacy] `bbox` object

UDFs defined using the legacy keyword `bbox` are automatically now mapped to `bounds`. Please update your code to use `bounds` directly as this alias will be removed in a future release.

## Call HTTP endpoints

A UDF called via an [HTTP endpoint](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#http-requests) is invoked as `File` or `Tile`, depending on the URL structure.

### File endpoint

This endpoint structure runs a UDF as a `File`. See implementation examples with [Felt](/user-guide/out/felt/#vector) and [Google Sheets](/user-guide/out/googlesheets/#2-create-a-url-for-the-udf) for vector.

```bash
https://www.fused.io/server/.../run/file?dtype_out_vector=csv
```

:::info
   In some cases, `dtype_out_vector=json` may return an error. This can happen when a GeoDataFrame without a `geometry` column is being return or a Pandas DataFrame. You can bypass this by using `dtype_out_vector=geojson`.
:::

### Tile endpoint

This endpoint structure runs a UDF as a `Tile`. The `{z}/{x}/{y}` templated path parameters correspond to the Tile's XYZ index, which Tiled web map clients dynamically populate. See implementation examples for Raster Tiles with [Felt](/user-guide/out/felt/#raster-tiles) and [DeckGL](/user-guide/out/deckgl/#raster-tile-layers), and for Vector Tiles with [DeckGL](/user-guide/out/deckgl/#vector-tile-layers) and [Mapbox](/user-guide/out/mapbox/#a-vector-tile-layers).

```bash
https://www.fused.io/server/.../run/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?&dtype_out_vector=csv
```

## Tile UDF behavior in `fused.run()`

UDFs behave different when using `fused.types.Tile` than in any other case. When passing a `gpd.GeoDataFrame`. `shapely.Geometry` to bounds:

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run(tile_udf, bounds=bounds)
```

Or passing `X Y Z`:

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run(tile_udf, x=1, y=2, z=3)
```

The `tile_udf` gets tiled and run on [Web mercator XYZ tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map) and then combined back together to speed up processing rather than executing a single run.

This is in contrast to most other UDFs (either using no `bounds` input at all or using `bounds: fused.types.Bounds`) which run a single run across the given input.
