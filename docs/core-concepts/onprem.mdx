Fused offers an on-prem version of our application in a Docker container. The container runs in your computing environment (such as AWS, GCP, or Azure) and your data stays under your control.

Our container is currently distributed via a private release. Email `info@fused.io` for access.

## Commands

### `run-config`

`run-config` runs the user's jobs. The job configuration can be specified either on the command line, as a local file path, or as an S3/GCS path. In all cases the job configuration is loaded as JSON.

```
Options:
  --config-from-gcs FILE_NAME   Job step configuration, as a GCS path
  --config-from-s3 FILE_NAME    Job step configuration, as a S3 path
  --config-from-file FILE_NAME  Job step configuration, as a file name the
                                application can load (i.e. mounted within the
                                container)

{/* Charles to double check this */}
You can setup your on prem credentials directly in Python:

```python showLineNumbers

import fused

fused.options.base_url = "***"
fused.options.auth.client_id = "***"
fused.options.auth.client_secret = "***"
fused.options.auth.audience = "***"
fused.options.auth.oauth_token_url = "***"
fused.options.auth.authorize_url = "***"
fused.options.auth.credentials_path = "***"

fused.options.save()
