# Dependencies

To keep things simple, Fused maintains a single runtime image. This means that any UDF you [run](/core-concepts/run-udfs/) will be executed with these dependencies by default

## UDF Dependencies

The Python packages are listed below and can also be found in [this](https://github.com/fusedio/fused-docs/blob/main/static/requirements_fused.txt) public `.txt` file.

import txt from 'raw-loader!/requirements_fused.txt';

{/* TODO: We need a way to for people to, well, get in touch. Discord? Slack? Specific email? */}
Get in touch to have a package added to the list of dependencies or to learn about private runtime images for your organization.

## [BETA] Adding your own dependencies

The simplest way to add your own library is to run the dedicated [Package Management Fused app](https://www.fused.io/workbench/apps/catalog/Package_Management-688daddc-dd51-4173-9003-d2bb5ddee72d). This app allows you to create a different environment and add any module you'd like

:::note
You need to make sure you have access to [Fused Apps](/workbench/app-builder/app-overview/) to be able to run this.

You'll then need to import the environment path in your UDF:

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf():
  import sys;
  sys.path.append(f"/mount/envs/demo_env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/")

  # Logic using your dedicated package
  return
```
