UDF work best when handling small amounts of data at time, but often datasets are large. This is where running UDFs in bulk becomes needed
{/* TODO: This should link to a "Best Practices" section about how big should the data processed by a single UDF be: 1 big large jobs, or many small jobs? */}

There are 2 main approaches to running multiple UDFs:
- **Using "offline" instances**
    - For high latency, large volumes of data
- **Using "real-time" instances**
    - For small requests to finish quick

### A Simple UDF

Here's a simple UDF:

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(val):
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.DataFrame({'val':[val]})
```

As mentioned in the [Single UDF section](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-single-udfs/), to call it 1 time we can do:

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run(udf, val=1)
```

Which returns:

```bash
  | val
------
0 | 1
```

We then have 2 options to run this multiple times:


## Using "offline" instances (`run_remote()`)

_When to use: This is for high-latency (anything more than a few seconds) parallel processing of longer or more complex jobs_


#### Running "offline" job
Using the same UDF as above we can run this UDF 10 times on an "offline" instance:

```python showLineNumbers
# We'll run this UDF 10 times
job = udf(arg_list=range(10))
job.run_remote()
```

This pushes a job onto a persistent machine on Fused server.

#### Accessing "offline" job logs

You can view the logs of all your on-going and past `run_remote()` jobs either:

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';
import ImgRunRemoteLogs from '@site/docs/core-concepts/run-udfs/run_remote_output.png';
import ImgRunRemoteEmail from '@site/docs/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-remote-email.png';

  <summary>In a notebook</summary>

    Running `job.run_remote()` in a notebook gives you a clickable link:

    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img src={ImgRunRemoteLogs} alt="Dark Vessel Detection workflow" style={{width: 800}} />
    </div>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>In Fused Workbench</summary>

    Under the "Jobs" tab, on the bottom left of Workbench:

    <ReactPlayer className="video__player" playing={false} muted={true} controls height="100%" url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/docs_rewrite/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-remote-job-logs.mp4" width="100%" />

</details>

<details>
  <summary>By email (you'll receive 1 email for each job)</summary>

    Each job leads to an email summary with logs upon completion:

    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img src={ImgRunRemoteEmail} alt="Dark Vessel Detection workflow" style={{width: 800}} />
    </div>

</details>


Tradeoffs:
- Takes a few seconds to startup machine
- Can run as long as needed

- Demo of basic example
- Show how to get logs in Fused
- Demo email answer you get after running this
 */}

## [Experimental] Using "real-time" instances (`run_pool` & `PoolRunner`)

_When to use: This is for quick jobs that can finish in less than 120s_

Tradeoffs:
- No startup time
- Will timeout after 120s

Topics:
- Demo basic example: fused.utils.common.PoolRunner()
- caveat with risk? I.e. expensive?
