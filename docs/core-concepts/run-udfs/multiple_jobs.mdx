UDF work best when handling small amounts of data at time, but often datasets are large. This is where running UDFs in bulk becomes needed
{/* TODO: This should link to a "Best Practices" section about how big should the data processed by a single UDF be: 1 big large jobs, or many small jobs? */}

There are 2 main approaches to running multiple UDFs:
- Using "offline" instances
    - For high latency, large volumes of data
- Using "real-time" instances
    - For small requests to finish quick

## Using "offline" instances (`run_remote()`)

_When to use: This is for high-latency (anything more than a few seconds) parallel processing of longer or more complex jobs_

{/* 
Topics:
- Demo of basic example
- Show how to get logs in Fused
- Demo email answer you get after running this
 */}

## [Experimental] Using "real-time" instances (`run_pool` & `PoolRunner`)

_When to use: This is for quick jobs that can finish in less than 120s_

{/* 
Topics:
- Demo basic example: fused.utils.common.PoolRunner()
- caveat with risk? I.e. expensive?
