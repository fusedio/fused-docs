Fused UDF functions really shine once you start calling them from anywhere. You can call small jobs in 2 main ways:
1.  [`fused.run()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedrun) in Python. All you need is the [`fused` Python](/python-sdk/#python-install) package installed
    - Useful when wanting to run a UDF as part of another pipeline, inside another UDF or anywhere in Python / code.
2.  [**HTTPS call**](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#https-requests) from *anywhere*
    - Useful when you want to call a UDF outside of Python. For example, receiving dataframes into Google Sheets or plotting points and images in a [Felt map](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/other-integrations/#felt)
{/* TODO: Might want to mention `fused.submit()` here to be able to run multiple jobs? */}

### Defining "Small" job

"Small" jobs are defined as any job being:
- Less than 120s to execute
- Using less than a few Gb of RAM to run

These jobs run in "real-time" with no start-up time, so are quick to run, but with limited resources and time-out if taking too long.

## [`fused.run()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedrun)

[`fused.run()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedrun) is the simplest & most common way to execute a UDF from any Python script or notebook.

The simplest way to call a public UDF is using a [public UDF name](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#public-udf-name) and calling it as: `UDF_` + name. Let's take this UDF that returns [the location of the Eiffel Tower](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/Single_point_Eiffel_Tower) in a `GeoDataFrame` as an example:

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run("UDF_Single_point_Eiffel_Tower")
```


![Simple UDF fused.run() returning a geodataframe](/img/core-concepts/run-udfs/running_simple_eiffel_tower_udf.png)

There are a few other ways to run a UDF:

- [By name from your account](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#name-from-your-account)
- [By public UDF name](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#public-udf-name)
- [Using a token](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#token)
- [Using a `udf` object](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#udf-object)
- [From Github URL](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#github-url)
- [From git commit hash (most recommended for teams)](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#git-commit-hash-recommended-for-most-stable-use-cases)

### _Name_ (from your account)

_When to use: When calling a UDF you made, from your own account._

You can call any UDFs you have made simply by referencing it by name (given when you [save a UDF](/core-concepts/write/#save-udfs)).

(Note: This requires authentication)


![Hello World UDF](/img/core-concepts/run-udfs/hello_world_bbox_udf.png)

This UDF can then be run in a notebook locally (granted that you have authenticated):

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run("Hello_World_bbox")
```


![Running Hello World UDF](/img/core-concepts/run-udfs/running_hello_world_bbox_udf.png)

### _Name_ (from your teammate's account)

_When to use: When calling a UDF someone on your team made, from your own account._

Similarly, you can reference by name and run any UDFs under your teammates' accounts. Simply prefix the UDF name with the person's email address, separated by a `/`.

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run("teammate@fused.io/Hello_World_bbox")
```

Note that both your and your teammate's accounts must belong to the same organization.

### _Public UDF Name_

_When to run: Whenever you want to run a public UDF for free from anywhere_

Any UDF saved in the [public UDF repo](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main) can be run for free.

Reference them by prefixing their name with `UDF_`. For example, [the public UDF `Get_Isochrone`](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/Get_Isochrone) is run with `UDF_Get_Isochrone`:

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run('UDF_Get_Isochrone')
```

### _Token_

_When to use: Whenever you want someone to be able to execute a UDF but might not want to share the code with them._

You can get the token from a UDF either in [Workbench](/workbench/) (Save your UDF then click "Share") or by returning the token in Python.

Here's a toy UDF that we want others to be able to run, but we don't want them to see the code:

```python showLineNumbers
# This example is from a notebook
import fused

@fused.udf()
def my_super_duper_private_udf(my_udf_input):
    import pandas as pd
    # This code is so private I don't want anyone to be able to read it
    return pd.DataFrame({"input": [my_udf_input]})
```

We then need to [save this UDF to Fused server](/core-concepts/write/#save-udfs) to make it accessible from anywhere.

```python showLineNumbers
# This example is from a notebook
my_super_duper_private_udf.to_fused()
```

:::note
`my_udf.to_fused()` saves your UDF to your personal user UDFs. These are private to you and your team. You can create a token that anyone (even outside your team) can use to run your UDF but by default these UDFs are private.
:::

We can create a token for this `my_super_duper_private_udf` and share it:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import LazyReactPlayer from '@site/src/components/LazyReactPlayer'

<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

    ```python showLineNumbers
    token = my_super_duper_private_udf.create_access_token()
    print(token)
    ```

    This would return something like: `'fsh_**********q6X'` (You can recognise this to be a shared token because it starts with `fsh_`)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="workbench" label="Workbench">

    You can create a Share Token directly from Workbench:

    <LazyReactPlayer playsinline={true} className="video__player" playing={true} muted={true} controls height="100%" url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/docs_rewrite/core-concepts/run-udfs/get_share_token.mp4" width="100%" />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you have your `'fsh_***'` token, you can use it to run your UDF:

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run(token, my_udf_input="I'm directly using the token object")
```

or directly:

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run('fsh_**********q6X', my_udf_input="I can't see your private UDF but can still run it")
```

### _UDF_ object

_When to run: When you're writing your UDF in the same Python file / jupyter notebook and want to refer to the Python object directly. You might want to do this to test your UDF works locally for example_

You may also pass a UDF Python object to `fused.run`:

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def local_udf():
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.DataFrame({})

# Note that by default fused.run() will run your UDF on the Fused serverless server so we pass engine='local' to run this as a normal Python function
fused.run(local_udf, engine='local')
```

### _Github URL_

{/* Need to emphasise why this isn't recommended  */}
_When to use: [Not recommended] This is useful if you're working on a branch that you control. This method always points to the last commit on a branch so your UDF can break without you knowing if someone else pushes a new commit or merges & deletes your branch_

```python showLineNumbers
gh_udf = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/REM_with_HyRiver/")
fused.run(gh_udf)
```

:::warning
We do NOT recommend you use this approach as your UDF might break if changes are done to it

    Especially using a URL pointing to a `main` branch means that your UDF will change if someone else pushes to it, in a way that isn't visible to you.

    For that reason we recommend using a [git commit hash](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#git-commit-hash-recommended-for-most-stable-use-cases) instead

:::

### _Git commit hash_ (recommended for most stable use cases)

_When to use: Whenever you want to rely on a UDF such as in production or when using a UDF as a building block for another UDF._

This is the safest way to use a UDF. Since you're pointing to a specific git commit hash, you won't end up with changes breaking your UDF.

Using a git commit hash is the safest, and thus recommended way to call UDFs from Github.

This does mean you need to update the commit where your UDFs are being called if you want to propagate updates. But this gives you the most amount of control.

Let's again take the example of the Simple Eiffel Tower UDF:

![Running Hello World UDF](/img/core-concepts/run-udfs/commit_hash_demo.png)

```python showLineNumbers
commit_hash = "bdfb4d0"
commit_udf = fused.load(f"https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/{commit_hash}/public/Single_point_Eiffel_Tower/")
fused.run(commit_udf)
```

### _Team UDF Names_

Team UDFs can be loaded or run by specifying the name "team", as in:

```python showLineNumbers
fused.load("team/udf_name")
```

This can be helpful when collaborating with team members as this does **not** require [making a shared token](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#token)

## Execution engines

{/* Need more details for this */}

`fused.run` can run the UDF in various execution modes, as specified by the `engine` parameter either local or remote

- `local`: Run in the current process.
- `remote`: Run in the serverless Fused cloud engine (this is the default).
{/*- `batch`: Run a long-running job in a Fused server. This must first be enabled for the account.*/}

```python showLineNumbers
# By default, fused.run will use the remote engine
fused.run(my_udf)
```

```python showLineNumbers
# To run locally, explicitly specify engine="local"
fused.run(my_udf, engine="local")
```

:::warning
> ⚠️ **Important change:** `fused.run()` now defaults to `engine="remote"` in all cases, even when users are not authenticated. Previously, it would default to `engine="local"` for unauthenticated users.
> If you are not authenticated, you must explicitly specify `engine="local"` to run UDFs locally.
:::

Set `sync=False` to run a UDF [asynchronously](/core-concepts/async/).

## Passing arguments in [`fused.run()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedrun)

A typical [`fused.run()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedrun) call of a UDF looks like this:

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def my_udf(inputs: str):
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.DataFrame({"output": [inputs]})

fused.run(my_udf, inputs="hello world")
```

A [`fused.run()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedrun) call will require the following arguments:

1. [Mandatory] The first argument needs to be the UDF to run (name, object, token, etc [as seen above](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#fusedrun))
2. [Optional] Any arguments of the UDF itself (if it has any). In the example above that's `inputs` because `my_udf` takes `inputs` as an argument.
3. [Optional] Any protected arguments as seen in the dedicated [API docs page](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedrun) (if applicable). These include for example:
   - `bounds` -> A geographical bounding box (as a list of 4 points: `[min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y]`) defining the area of interest.
   - `cache_max_age` -> The maximum [age of the UDF's cache](/core-concepts/cache/#defining-your-cache-lifetime-cache_max_age).
   - `dtype_out_raster` -> The output raster format. Defaults to "tif". Change this to "png" for a simple preview of your image.
   - `dtype_out_vector` -> The output vector format. Defaults to "parquet".

#### Examples of using parameters

Changing the default cache max age:
```python showLineNumbers
fused.run("UDF_CDLs_Tile_Example", cache_max_age='1d')
```

Calling a public UDF that returns a raster, this might be helpful if you want a simple visualization of your raster without needing other requirements like `rasterio` & `rioxxaray`:
```python showLineNumbers
fused.run("UDF_CDLs_Tile_Example", dtype_out_raster='png')
```

## Running jobs in parallel: [`fused.submit()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedsubmit)

Sometimes you want to run a UDF over a list of inputs (for example running a [UDF that unzips a file over a list of files](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/use-cases/dark-vessel-detection/#33---run-this-udf-over-a-month-of-ais-data)). If each run itself is quite small, then you can run a batch of UDFs over a list of inputs.

:::warning fused.submit() should not be run in Workbench 
Since Workbench can automatically run UDFs on every code change, it is not recommended to use `fused.submit()` in Workbench as this can trigger a large number of multi-processing jobs. 

We recommend using `fused.submit()` in a notebook or script only.
:::

Let's use a simple UDF to demonstrate:

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(val):
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.DataFrame({'val':[val]})
```

Say we wanted to run this `udf` 10 times over:

```python showLineNumbers
inputs = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

### [`fused.submit()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedsubmit)

Fused is built to help you scale your processing to huge datasets and the core of this ability is [`fused.submit()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedsubmit). You can run 1 UDF over a large number of arguments:

```python showLineNumbers
# This example is from a notebook, not workbench
results = fused.submit(udf, inputs)

>>> 100%|██████████| 10/10 
```

[`fused.submit()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedsubmit) runs all these jobs in parallel and defaults to directly returning the results back to you as a dataframe:

```python showLineNumbers
# This example is from a notebook, not workbench
results

>>>
 		val
val
0	0	0
1	0	1
...
```

### Tips for using [`fused.submit()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedsubmit)

- Check that your parameters are correctly setup with `debug_mode=True` (more detail [below](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#debug-mode))

```python showLineNumbers
# This example is from a notebook, not workbench
single_run = fused.submit(udf, inputs, debug_mode=True)
```

- Start with a small number of jobs, then scale up

```python showLineNumbers   
# This example is from a notebook, not workbench
# Assuming inputs is a list
results = fused.submit(udf, inputs[:10])
```

- Check the runtime of each job:

```python showLineNumbers
# This example is from a notebook, not workbench
# Run only 10 jobs and see how long each one took
results = fused.submit(udf, inputs[:10], collect=False)
results.times()
```

:::tip Job length rule of thumb: 30-45s
Aim for a single UDF job that takes 30-45s. This gives you a "safety" margin as UDFs will [timeout after 120s](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#defining-small-job). So jobs can still take a bit longer and not time out.

### Advanced [`fused.submit()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedsubmit) options

#### Blocking vs non-blocking calls

By default we've set up [`fused.submit()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedsubmit) to be blocking, meaning it will wait for all the jobs to finish before returning the results.

However, you can set `collect=False` and then track the progress of jobs as they run:

```python showLineNumbers
# This example is from a notebook, not workbench
results = fused.submit(udf, inputs, collect=False)
```

#### Real time logs

- Show a progress bar of number of jobs completed:

```python showLineNumbers
# This example is from a notebook, not workbench
results.wait()
```

```
100%|██████████| 10/10 [00:01<00:00, 9.31it/s]
```

- Show total time it took to run all the jobs:

```python showLineNumbers
# This example is from a notebook, not workbench
results.total_time()
```

```
>>> datetime.timedelta(seconds=1, microseconds=96764)
```

- Check the first error that occurred:

```python showLineNumbers
# This example is from a notebook, not workbench
results.first_error()
```

```
>>> fused.types.UdfRuntimeError("[Run #0 {'val': 3'}] my error message here...")
```


- Get your data back as a dataframe:

```python showLineNumbers
# This example is from a notebook, not workbench
results.collect()
```

```python showLineNumbers
>>>
 		val
val
0	0	0
1	0	1
...
```

#### Debug mode

Sometimes you might just want to make sure your code is running correctly before kicking off a large number of jobs. That's what Debug Mode allows you to do:

```python showLineNumbers
# This example is from a notebook, not workbench
results = fused.submit(udf, inputs, debug_mode=True)
```

This will run the first item in `inputs` directly using `fused.run()` (equivalent to `fused.run(udf, inputs[0])`) and then return the results:

```python showLineNumbers
>>>
	val
0	0
```

You can then set `debug_mode` back to False and be more confident that your UDF is working as expected!

#### Execution parameters

[`fused.submit()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedsubmit) also have parameters giving you more control over the execution. See the Python SDK [docs page](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedsubmit) for more details:

- `max_workers`: The number of workers to use for the job pool.
- `engine`: `local` or `remote` (default is `remote`).
    Just like `fused.run()`, by default `fused.submit()` will run the UDF in the Fused server (`engine='remote'`). You can set `engine='local'` to run `udf` locally either on your machine or inside a large machine that you spin up.
- `max_retry`: The maximum number of retries for a job.

 #### Benchmarking

<details>
  <summary>Simple [`fused.submit()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedsubmit) Benchmark</summary>

    `fused.submit(udf)` runs all the UDF calls in parallel, making it a helpful tool to run multiple UDFs all at once.

    We can demonstrate this by adding a simple `time.sleep(1)` in our original UDF:
    ```python {4-5} showLineNumbers
    @fused.udf
    def udf(val):
        import pandas as pd
        import time
        time.sleep(1)
        return pd.DataFrame({'val':[val]})
    ```

    In a notebook, we can time how long each cell takes to execute with the [`%%time` magic command](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-time)

    ```python showLineNumbers
    # In a jupyter notebook
    %%time
    fused.run(udf, val=1)
    ```

    ![Singe run](/img/core-concepts/run-udfs/fused_run_single_job.png)

    This takes 2s: A few ms of overhead to send the UDF to Fused server & run + 1s of `time.sleep(1)`

    Now using `fused.submit()` to run this over 50 UDFs:

    ![30 runs](/img/core-concepts/run-udfs/submit_50jobs.png)

    This takes a few more seconds, but not 100s. `fused.submit()` is a helpful way to scale a single UDF to many inputs in a timely manner.


</details>

### Example use cases

`fused.submit()` is used in many places across our docs, here are some examples:

- ⛴️ In the Dark Vessel Detection example to [scale retrieving](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/use-cases/dark-vessel-detection/#33---run-this-udf-over-a-month-of-ais-data) daily AIS `.zip` files from NOAA over 30 days.
- 🛰️ [Retrieving all of Maxar's Open Data STAC Catalogs](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/use-cases/exploring_maxar_data/#preparing-fusedsubmit-to-run-in-parallel) across every events they have imagery for.
- 💡 Check the [Best Practices](/core-concepts/best-practices/udf-best-practices/#run-tasks-in-parallel) for more on when to use `submit()` and when to use other methods.

## HTTPS requests

{/* Need to showcase this in video */}

You can call Saved UDFs via HTTPs calls, effecitvaly turning your data in an API!

The same can be done with the [Fused Python SDK](/python-sdk/).

#### Shared token

When you save a UDF for the first time, it by default creates a shared token for you, something like:

```
fsh_**********h4t
```

This is a unique token that is used to identify your UDF and call it via HTTPS requests

Here is what a UDF endpoint looks like:

```
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/******/run/file?dtype_out_raster=png
```

Manage your account's shared tokens in [here](https://www.fused.io/workbench/tokens).

### Passing parameters

You can also pass parameters to your UDF via the URL by adding [query parameters](https://www.branch.io/glossary/query-parameters/) (`&param=value`) to the URL.

For example a UDF that takes `lat` and `lon` as parameters:

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(lat, lon):
    return pd.DataFrame({'lat': [lat], 'lon': [lon]})
```

Could be called with:

```
https://www.fused.io/...&lat=37.7749&lon=-121.4194
```

### Tiling 

You can integrate your UDF as a vector or raster tile server y adding `tiles` path parameter, followed by templated `/{z}/{x}/{y}` path parameters.

You need to make sure:
- Your UDF is set to [Tile mode](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/filetile/#tile)
- You properly pass `/{z}/{x}/{y}` instead of default value
- Depending on your server type, you might need to add `dtype_out_raster` or `dtype_out_vector` parameters. For example [QGIS](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/other-integrations/#qgis) requires you to use `dtype_out_vector=mvt` for [vector tile servers](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/other-integrations/#vector-tiles-1)

```
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/******/run/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?dtype_out_raster=png
```

See our [integration guides](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/other-integrations/) for examples.

### Private token

Calling UDFs with [Bearer authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/) requires an [account's private token](/python-sdk/authentication/#get-bearer-access-token). The URL structure to run UDFs with the private token varies slightly, as the URL specifies the UDF's name and the owner's user account.

```bash
curl -XGET "https://app.fused.io/server/v1/realtime/fused/api/v1/run/udf/saved/user@fused.io/caltrain_live_location?dtype_out_raster=png" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

:::warning Do not share your Bearer token

Do not share your Bearer token with anyone. These allow to impersonate your account and should be treated as such.

:::

The `dtype_out_vector` and `dtype_out_raster` parameters define the output data type for vector tables and raster arrays, respectively.

- The supported types for vector tables are `parquet`, [`geojson`](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/other-integrations/#deckgl), [`json`](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/other-integrations/#deckgl), `feather`, `csv`, [`mvt`](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/other-integrations/#mapbox), `html`, `excel`, and `xml`.
- For raster array: [`png`](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/other-integrations/#deckgl), `gif`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `webp`, `tif`, and `tiff`.

```
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/****/run/file?dtype_out_raster=png
```

Read how to structure HTTPS endpoints to call the UDF as a [Map Tile & File](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/filetile/#call-https-endpoints).


### Calling UDFs without Python SDK 

You can also run a whole UDF directly in the HTTP request without needing Python when making the call

You first do need to retrieve your [bearer token](/python-sdk/authentication/#get-bearer-access-token) (this requires Python):
```python showLineNumbers
# Figure out your bearer token:
from fused._auth import AUTHORIZATION
AUTHORIZATION.credentials.access_token
```

This returns something like:
```bash
'eyJ4K9pL2Mx...'
```

Next we need to do a POST request to the Fused server endpoint: `'https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime/basic-tier/api/v1/run/udf'`

You'll need the client_id:

**Without an environment (Basic Tier):**

Simply use `basic-tier` as your client_id name.

**With environment**

1. In [Workbench](/workbench/), go to "Preferences"
2. Write down the "Kernel" name you see displayed, in this case `fused`:

[Finding your kernel name in Workbench](/img/core-concepts/run-udfs/kernel_name_from_workbench.png)

Here is an example call with a simple "Hello World" UDF using the `basic-tier` account:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime/basic-tier/api/v1/run/udf' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <BEARER_TOKEN_GOES_HERE>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"step_config":"{\"type\":\"udf\",\"udf\":{\"type\":\"geopandas_v2\",\"name\":\"azure_lion\",\"entrypoint\":\"udf\",\"parameters\":{},\"metadata\":{\"fused:udfType\":\"auto\",\"fused:slug\":\"azure_lion\",\"fused:name\":\"azure_lion\"},\"code\":\"@fused.udf\\ndef udf(name: str = \\\"world\\\"):\\n    import pandas as pd\\n\\n    return pd.DataFrame({\\\"hello\\\": [name]})\\n\",\"headers\":[]}}","dtype_in":"json","dtype_out_vector":"geojson","dtype_out_raster":"png","cache":true}'
```

This:
- Runs the following UDF directly being passing it through the HTTP request:
```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(name: str = "world"):
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.DataFrame({"hello": [name]})
```
- On the `basic-tier` account (or whatever account you are using)
If you're using a subscribed account, you'll need to adjust the `basic-tier` to fit your environment:

```bash
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime/<your-client-id>/api/v1/run/udf
```

## Caching responses

If a UDF's [cache](/core-concepts/cache/) is enabled, its endpoints cache outputs for each combination of code and parameters. The first call runs and caches the UDF, and subsequent calls return cached data.
