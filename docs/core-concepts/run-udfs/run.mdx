Fused UDF functions really shine once you start calling them from anywhere. You can call small jobs in 2 main ways:
1.  `fused.run()` in Python. All you need is the [`fused` Python](/python-sdk/#install) package installed
    - Useful when wanting to run UDF as part of another pipeline, inside another UDF or anywhere in Python / code.
2.  [**HTTP call**](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-single-udfs/#http-requests) from *anywhere*
    - Useful when you want to call a UDF outside of Python. For example receiving a [dataframe into Google Sheets](/user-guide/out/googlesheets/) or plotting points and images in a [Felt map](/user-guide/out/felt/)

### Defining "Small" job

"Small" jobs are defined as any job being:
- Less than 120s to execute
- Using less than a few Gb of RAM to run

These jobs run in "real-time" with no start-up time so are quick to run, but with limited resources and time-out if taking too long. 

## `fused.run()`

All you need to run a UDF within Python is:
- [`fused` package](/python-sdk/#install) installed

The simplest way to call a public UDF is using a [public UDF name](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-single-udfs/#public-udf-name) and calling it as: `UDF_` + name. Let's take this UDF that returns [the location of the Eiffel Tower](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/Single_point_Eiffel_Tower) in a `GeoDataFrame` as an example:

```python showLineNumbers
import fused
fused.run("UDF_Single_point_Eiffel_Tower")
```

import ImgSimpleETUDF from '@site/static/img/core-concepts/run-udfs/running_simple_eiffel_tower_udf.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImgSimpleETUDF} alt="Simple UDF fused.run() returning a geodataframe" style={{width: 400}} />
</div>

There are a few other ways to run a UDF:
- [By name from your account](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-single-udfs/#name-from-your-account)
- [By public UDF name](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-single-udfs/#public-udf-name)
- [Using a token](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-single-udfs/#token)
- [Using a `udf` object](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-single-udfs/#udf-object)
- [From Github URL](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-single-udfs/#github-url)
- [From git commit hash (most recommended for teams)](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-single-udfs/#git-commit-hash-recommended-for-most-stable-use-cases)

### _Name_ (from your account)

_When to use: When calling a UDF you made, from your own account._

You can call any UDFs you have made simply by calling it by name (given when you [save a UDF](/core-concepts/write/#save-udfs)).

(Note: This requires authentication)

import ImgHelloWorldUDF from '@site/static/img/core-concepts/run-udfs/hello_world_bbox_udf.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImgHelloWorldUDF} alt="Hello World UDF" style={{width: 700}} />
</div>

This UDF can then be run in a notebook locally (granted that you have authenticated):

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run("Hello_World_bbox")
```

import ImgRunHWUDF from '@site/static/img/core-concepts/run-udfs/running_hello_world_bbox_udf.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImgRunHWUDF} alt="RunningHello World UDF" style={{width: 700}} />
</div>

### _Public UDF Name_

_When to run: Whenever you want to run a public UDF for free from anywhere_

Any UDF saved in the [public UDF repo](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main) can be run for free.

Reference them by prefixing their name with `UDF_`. For example, [the public UDF `Get_Isochrone`](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/Get_Isochrone) is run with `UDF_Get_Isochrone`:

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run('UDF_Get_Isochrone')
```

### _Token_

_When to use: Whenever you want someone to be able to execute a UDF but might not want to share the code with them._

You can get the token from a UDF either in [Workbench](/workbench/) (Save your UDF then go to "Settings" -> "Share" -> "Fused App") or returning the token in Python.

Here's a toy UDF that we want others to be able to run, but we don't want them to see the code:
```python showLineNumbers
import fused

@fused.udf()
def my_super_duper_private_udf(my_udf_input):
    import pandas as pd
    # This code is so private I don't want anyone to be able to read it
    return pd.DataFrame({"input": [my_udf_input]})
```

We then need to [save this UDF to Fused server](/core-concepts/write/#save-udfs) to make it accessible from anywhere.

```python showLineNumbers
my_super_duper_private_udf.to_fused()
```

:::note
    `my_udf.to_fused()` saves your UDF to your personal user UDFs. These are private to you and your team. You can create a token than anyone (even outside your team) can use to run your UDF but by default these UDFs are private.
:::

We can create a token for this `my_super_duper_private_udf` and share it:

```python showLineNumbers
from fused.api import FusedAPI
api = FusedAPI()
token = api.create_udf_access_token("my_super_duper_private_udf").token
print(token)
```

This would return something like: `'fsh_**********q6X'` (You can recognise this to be a shared token because it starts with `fsh_`)

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run(token, my_udf_input="I'm directly using the token object")
```
or directly:

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run('fsh_**********q6X', my_udf_input="I can't see you're private UDF but can still run it")
```


### _UDF_ object

_When to run: When you're writing your UDF in the same Python file / jupyter notebook and want to refer to the Python object directly. You might want to do this to test your UDF works locally for example_

You may also pass a UDF Python object to `fused.run`:

```python showLineNumbers
# Running a local UDF
@fused.udf
def local_udf():
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.DataFrame({})

# Note that by default fused.run() will run your UDF on the Fused serverless server so we pass engine='local' to run this as a normal Python function
fused.run(local_udf, engine='local')
```

### _Github URL_

{/* Need to emphasise why this isn't recommended  */}
_When to use: [Not recommended] This is useful if you're working on a branch that you control over. This method always points to the last commit on a branch so your UDF can break without you knowing if someone else pushes a new commit or merges & deletes your branch_

```python showLineNumbers
gh_udf = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/REM_with_HyRiver/")
fused.run(gh_udf)
```

:::warning
    We do NOT recommend you use this approach as your UDF might break if changes are done to it
    
    Especially using a URL pointing to a `main` branch means that your UDF will change if someone else pushes towards it, in a way that isn't visible to you.

    For that reason we recommend using [git commit hash](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-single-udfs/#git-commit-hash-recommended-for-most-stable-use-cases) instead
:::

### _Git commit hash_ (recommended for most stable use cases)

_When to use: Whenever you want to rely on a UDF such as in production or when using a UDF as a building block for another UDF._

This is the safest way to use a UDF. Since you're pointing to a specific git commit hash you won't end up with changes breaking your UDF.

Using a git commit hash is the safest, and thus recommended way to call UDFs from Github.

This does mean you need to update the commit where your UDFs are being called if you want to propagate updates. But this gives you the most amount of control.

Let's again take the example of the Simple Eiffel Tower UDF:

import ImgCommitHash from '@site/static/img/core-concepts/run-udfs/commit_hash_demo.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImgCommitHash} alt="RunningHello World UDF" style={{width: 700}} />
</div>

```python showLineNumbers
commit_hash = "bdfb4d0"
commit_udf = fused.load(f"https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/{commit_hash}/public/Single_point_Eiffel_Tower/")
fused.run(commit_udf)
```

## Execution engines

{/* Need more details for this */}

`fused.run` can run the UDF in various execution modes, as specified by the `engine` parameter either local, realtime, or batch mode.

- `local`: Run in the current process.
- `realtime`: Run in the serverless Fused cloud engine.
- `batch`: Run a long-running job in a Fused server. This must first be enabled for the account.

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run(my_udf, engine="realtime")
```

Set `sync=False` to run a UDF [asynchronously](/core-concepts/async/).

### Passing arguments in `fused.run()`

{/* 
Need to write how to pass arguments 
- when to pass arguments (bbox most common, then other args)
- how to do it
- linking to batch process?
*/}

## Running multiple small `fused.run()` jobs in parallel

Sometimes you want to run a UDF over a list of inputs (for example running a [UDF that unzips a file over a list of files](/user-guide/examples/dark-vessel-detection/#33---run-this-udf-over-a-year-of-ais-data)). If each run itself is quite small, than you can run all a batch of UDFs over a list of inputs.

Let's use a simple UDF to demonstrate:

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(val):
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.DataFrame({'val':[val]})
```

Say we wanted to run this `udf` 10 times over `inputs = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`:

#### [Experimental] Using `run_pool` and `PoolRunner`

:::note
    This is not a feature directly implemented in `fused`. Instead we're going to use a code from the `fused.public.common` utils module, that might change over time
    
    You can learn more about import utils from UDFs [here](/core-concepts/write/#import-utils-from-other-udfs)
:::

`PoolRunner` allows to quickly run a UDF a few times over a dataset or a list of inputs. Using a `lambda` function you can map the function to pass to `PoolRunner`:

```python showLineNumbers
runner = fused.utils.common.PoolRunner(lambda val: fused.run(udf, val=val), range(10))
runner.get_result_all()
```

In a notebook `runner.get_result_all()` prints the progress status over time until the job is done:

import ImgPoolRunner from '@site/docs/core-concepts/run-udfs/poolrunner-get_results_all.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img src={ImgPoolRunner} alt="Pool Runner" style={{width: 600}} />
</div>

#### Getting "real-time" results

You can then get all your results by concatinating them:

```python showLineNumbers
# In this example udf() returns a Pandas DataFrame so `.get_concat()` 
result = runner.get_concat()
```

with `type(result)` being a `pandas.core.frame.DataFrame`

import ImgSingleUDFTime from '@site/docs/core-concepts/run-udfs/PoolRunner_timer_single_udf.png';
import Img10UDFTime from '@site/docs/core-concepts/run-udfs/PoolRunner_timer_10_udfs.png';

<details>
  <summary>Simple `PoolRunner` Benchmark</summary>

    `PoolRunner` runs all the UDF calls in parallel, making a helpful tool to run multiple UDFs all at once.

    We can demonstrate this by adding a simple `time.sleep(1)` in our original UDF:
    ```python {3-4} showLineNumbers
    @fused.udf
    def udf(val):
        import pandas as pd
        import time
        time.sleep(1)
        return pd.DataFrame({'val':[val]})
    ```

    In a notebook, we can time how long each cell takes to execute with the [`%%time` magic command](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-time)

    ```python showLineNumbers
    # In a jupyter notebook
    %%time
    fused.run(udf, val=1)
    ```

    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
        <img src={ImgSingleUDFTime} alt="Pool Runner" style={{width: 600}} />
    </div>

    This takes 1.8s: A few ms of overhead to send the UDF to Fused server & run + 1s of `time.sleep(1)`

    Now using `PoolRunner` to run this over `range(10)`:

    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
        <img src={Img10UDFTime} alt="Pool Runner" style={{width: 600}} />
    </div>

    This takes a few more seconds, but not 10s. `PoolRunner` is a helpful way to scale a single UDF to many inputs in a timely manner.

## HTTP requests

{/* Need to showcase this in video */}

In the UDF Builder, you can create an HTTP endpoint for a UDF in the ["Snippets"](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/#share-snippets) section. This generates a unique URL to call the UDF via HTTP requests. The URL is scoped to that UDF only and it can be revoked to disable access. The same can be done with the [Fused Python SDK](/python-sdk/).

### Shared token

To run a UDF via HTTP request, create a [shared token](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/#share-snippets) then modify the provided URL. Manage your account's shared tokens in [fused.io/profile#tokens](https://www.fused.io/profile#tokens).

Structure the URL with the `file` path parameter to run as a single batch operation.

```
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/******/run/file?dtype_out_raster=png
```

To integrate with a tiling service, structure the URL with the `tiles` path parameter, followed by templated `/{z}/{x}/{y}` path parameters. See [Lonboard](/user-guide/out/lonboard/) for an example.

```
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/******/run/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?dtype_out_raster=png
```

### Private token

Calling UDFs with [Bearer authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/) requires an account's private token. The URL structure to run UDFs with the private token varies slightly, as the URL specifies the UDF's name and the owner's user account.

```bash
curl -XGET "https://app.fused.io/server/v1/realtime/fused/api/v1/run/udf/saved/user@fused.io/caltrain_live_location?dtype_out_raster=png" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Specify parameters

When UDF endpoints are called via HTTP requests argument values are specified with [query parameters](https://www.branch.io/glossary/query-parameters/), which require input parameters to be serializable. As such, the UDF should specify the types to cast them to. Read more about [supported types for UDF parameters](/python-sdk/#typing).

### Response data types

The `dtype_out_vector` and `dtype_out_raster` parameters define the output data type for vector tables and raster arrays, respectively.

- The supported types for vector tables are `parquet`, [`geojson`](/user-guide/out/deckgl/#vector-tile-layers), [`json`](/user-guide/out/deckgl/#h3hexagonlayer), `feather`, [`csv`](/user-guide/out/googlesheets/), [`mvt`](/user-guide/out/mapbox/#2-create-a-mapbox-html-map), `html`, `excel`, and `xml`.
- For raster array: [`png`](/user-guide/out/deckgl/#raster-tile-layers), `gif`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `webp`, `tif`, and `tiff`.

```
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/****/run/file?dtype_out_raster=png
```

Read how to structure HTTP endpoints to call the UDF as a [Map Tile & File](/core-concepts/filetile/#call-http-endpoints).

## Caching responses

If a UDF's [cache](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/#cache) is enabled, its endpoints cache outputs for each combination of code and parameters. The first call runs and caches the UDF, and subsequent calls return cached data.
