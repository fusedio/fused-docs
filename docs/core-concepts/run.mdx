{/* All UDFs have a secure HTTP endpoint callable via a [web request](/core-concepts/run/#http-requests) or [`fused.run`](/core-concepts/run/#fusedrun) that is authorized with a [shared](/core-concepts/run/#shared-token) or [private](/core-concepts/run/#private-token) token. The endpoint's response may be [cached](/core-concepts/run/#caching-responses) and have its type [specified](/core-concepts/run/#response-data-types). */}

Fused UDF functions really shine once you start calling them from anywhere. You can do so in 2 main ways:
1.  `fused.run()` in Python. All you need is [`fused` Python](/python-sdk/) package is installed
    - This is when you want to use a UDF in another pipeline
2.  [**HTTP call**](/core-concepts/run/#http-requests) from *anywhere*
    - This is when you want to call a UDF outside of Python. For example receiving a [dataframe into Google Sheets](/user-guide/out/googlesheets/) or plotting points and images in a [Felt map](/user-guide/out/felt/)

## `fused.run`

All you need to run a UDF within Python is:
- [`fused` package](/python-sdk/#install) installed
- Access to your team projects to run private UDFs

{/* The first argument of `fused.run` specifies the UDF. [Reserved parameters](/core-concepts/write/#reserved-parameters) specify `bbox` and control how the UDF will be executed. Any additional arguments are passed to the function. The UDF runs as [Tile](/core-concepts/filetile/#call-fusedrun) if a [`bbox` is specified](/core-concepts/filetile/#call-fusedrun). */}

{/* ### Ways to run a UDF */}

The simplest way to call a UDF is using a public UDF and simply calling it by `UDF_` + name. Let's take this simple UDF that returns [the location of the Eiffel Tower](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/Single_point_Eiffel_Tower) in a `GeoDataFrame`:

```python showLineNumbers
import fused
fused.run("UDF_Single_point_Eiffel_Tower")
```

There are a few other ways to run a UDF:
- [By name from your account](/core-concepts/run/#name-from-your-account)
- [By public UDF name](/core-concepts/run/#tokens-public)
- [Using a shared token](/core-concepts/run/#tokens-shared)
- [Using a `udf` object](/core-concepts/run/#udf-object)
- [From Github URL](/core-concepts/run/#github-url)
- [From git commit hash (most recommended for teams)](/core-concepts/run/#git-commit-hash-recommended-for-teams)

#### _Name_ (from your account)

{/* Need to explain what name is compared to other */}
**UDF name.** Use this to run UDFs in your account. This requires authentication.

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run("My_Udf")
```

#### _Tokens_ (Public)

**Public token.** UDFs in the [public repo](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main) may be run for free and without authentication. Reference them by prefixing their name with `UDF_`. For example, the UDF `Get_Isochrone` is run with `UDF_Get_Isochrone`.

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run('UDF_Get_Isochrone')
```

#### _Tokens_ (Shared)

**Shared token.** [Shared tokens](/core-concepts/run/#shared-token), prefixed with `fsh_`, allow anyone to run a UDF from anywhere. It does not require authentication and runs on the execution environment of account that created the token.

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run('fsh_aJHN0awSfHLpYYinPSLYC')
```


#### _UDF_ object

You may also pass a UDF object to `fused.run`. Define a UDF in the local process, or load one with [`fused.load`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#load) from GitHub or your account.


**Local UDF object.** Define a UDF and pass the function object.

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def local_udf():
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.DataFrame({})

fused.run(local_udf)
```

#### Github URL

{/* Need to emphasise why this isn't recommended  */}

**Load from GitHub.** Loading the UDF requires read access to the repo.

```python showLineNumbers
gh_udf = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/REM_with_HyRiver/")
fused.run(gh_udf)
```

#### Git commit hash (recommended for teams)

{/* Need to explain *WHY* this is the best, recommended option */}

```python showLineNumbers
commit_udf = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/<commit_hash>/My_teams_UDF/")
fused.run(commit_udf)
```

## Execution engines

{/* Need more details for this */}

`fused.run` can run the UDF in various execution modes, as specified by the `engine` parameter either local, realtime, or batch mode.

- `local`: Run in the current process.
- `realtime`: Run in the serverless Fused cloud engine.
- `batch`: Run a long-running job in a Fused server. This must first be enabled for the account.

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run(my_udf, engine="realtime")
```

Set `sync=False` to run a UDF [asynchronously](/core-concepts/async/).

## HTTP requests

{/* Need to showcase this in video */}

In the UDF Builder, you can create an HTTP endpoint for a UDF in the ["Snippets"](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/#share-snippets) section. This generates a unique URL to call the UDF via HTTP requests. The URL is scoped to that UDF only and it can be revoked to disable access. The same can be done with the [Fused Python SDK](/python-sdk/).

### Shared token

To run a UDF via HTTP request, create a [shared token](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/#share-snippets) then modify the provided URL. Manage your account's shared tokens in [fused.io/profile#tokens](https://www.fused.io/profile#tokens).

Structure the URL with the `file` path parameter to run as a single batch operation.

```
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/******/run/file?dtype_out_raster=png
```

To integrate with a tiling service, structure the URL with the `tiles` path parameter, followed by templated `/{z}/{x}/{y}` path parameters. See [Lonboard](/user-guide/out/lonboard/) for an example.

```
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/******/run/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?dtype_out_raster=png
```

### Private token

Calling UDFs with [Bearer authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/) requires an account's private token. The URL structure to run UDFs with the private token varies slightly, as the URL specifies the UDF's name and the owner's user account.

```bash
curl -XGET "https://app.fused.io/server/v1/realtime/fused/api/v1/run/udf/saved/user@fused.io/caltrain_live_location?dtype_out_raster=png" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Specify parameters

When UDF endpoints are called via HTTP requests argument values are specified with [query parameters](https://www.branch.io/glossary/query-parameters/), which require input parameters to be serializable. As such, the UDF should specify the types to cast them to. Read more about [supported types for UDF parameters](/python-sdk/#typing).

### Response data types

The `dtype_out_vector` and `dtype_out_raster` parameters define the output data type for vector tables and raster arrays, respectively.

- The supported types for vector tables are `parquet`, [`geojson`](/user-guide/out/deckgl/#vector-tile-layers), [`json`](/user-guide/out/deckgl/#h3hexagonlayer), `feather`, [`csv`](/user-guide/out/googlesheets/), [`mvt`](/user-guide/out/mapbox/#2-create-a-mapbox-html-map), `html`, `excel`, and `xml`.
- For raster array: [`png`](/user-guide/out/deckgl/#raster-tile-layers), `gif`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `webp`, `tif`, and `tiff`.

```
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/****/run/file?dtype_out_raster=png
```

Read how to structure HTTP endpoints to call the UDF as a [Map Tile & File](/core-concepts/filetile/#call-http-endpoints).

## Caching responses

If a UDF's [cache](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/#cache) is enabled, its endpoints cache outputs for each combination of code and parameters. The first call runs and caches the UDF, and subsequent calls return cached data.
