You can setup your on prem credentials directly in Python:

```python showLineNumbers
import fused

fused.options.base_url = "***"
fused.options.auth.client_id = "***"
fused.options.auth.client_secret = "***"
fused.options.auth.audience = "***"
fused.options.auth.oauth_token_url = "***"
fused.options.auth.authorize_url = "***"

fused.options.save()
```

Fused will provide the above values via secure communication.

The code above only needs to be run once. After this is complete, Fused will use the local configuration for future batch jobs.

Note: if Fused has already been configured for batch jobs, you may need to remove the local `~/.fused` directory before running the above code.
