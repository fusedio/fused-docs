## Introduction

Welcome to the End to End DuckDB course! This course will take you from the basics of DuckDB to advanced integration with Fused.

[![Open In Workbench Collection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open_In_Workbench_Collection-16-green?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Fused_Course_Module1-37ec2eb3-6481-4cb1-b406-f8e39c339a52)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:
- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of data structures
- Familiarity with pandas
- Fused installed and configured

:::note
You'll need to be [logged in](/user-guide/login/) with an account to be able to follow this course.

Without having an environment you can still access [Workbench](/workbench/), [install](/python-sdk/#install) `fused` locally and [run Public UDFs](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#public-udf-name) (in Workbench & locally). You can also run any UDF you want locally with `fused.run(my_udf, engine='local')`.

## Getting Started

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
  <TabItem value="workbench" label="In Workbench" default>

    Workbench is Fused browser-based IDE. We have a [whole detailed section](/workbench) about it, but we'll take you through the basics here.

    You can start by opening [Fused Workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench) in another tab.

    Choose `Add UDF` and then `+ New UDF`, which will start creating a new UDF:

    Welcome to workbench! üõ†Ô∏è

    You now have access to a full Python development environment directly in your browser, where you can
    - Edit your UDFs in real time
    - See the geospatial output in the map view
    - Debug & explore data in the `Stdout` tab of the Results page

    :::info

      You can still use Workbench as a read-only user if you aren't signed-up, but to use the full benefit of workbench, [login](https://www.fused.io/workbench/preferences) or [join our waitlist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NVzMjc2tXxlIgnFrxqQPM_NtG1B2AQ0En_pAbZHYSK0)

    :::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="local" label="Locally">

    You can also do everything from your local machine (or anywhere else!) using `fused`. To use `fused` locally you first need to [install it](/python-sdk/#install):

    ```python showLineNumbers
    pip install fused
    ```

    :::info

    We recommend you use a virtual environment to work with `fused` and you'll need `python >=3.11`. Read more in the dedicated [Install Fused section](/python-sdk/#install)

    :::

    We recommend using [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) as these allow you to run cell by cell and see output directly under code blocks. In a new notebook we can define our first UDF:

    ```python showLineNumbers
    @fused.udf
    def udf(message: str = "Hello World!"):
        return message
    ```

    You can now run this UDF from your notebook:
    
    ```python showLineNumbers
    msg = fused.run(udf)
    ```

    :::note
    You'll need to be [logged in](/user-guide/login/) to be able to run a UDF on our Fused server. 

    If you either don't have an account or only have a free account without any environment you can still run UDF, but locally on your device:

    ```python showLineNumbers
    msg = fused.run(udf, engine='local')
    ```
