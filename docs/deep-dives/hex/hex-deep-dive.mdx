# H3 Hexagons Deep Dive

üöß Work in Progress üöß

{/* TODO: Needs an intro to what this deep dive will cover:
- Using data on Source Coop so anyone can access it
- Writing UDFs that can aggregate & join different datasets
 */}

## Prerequisites

In order to follow along we recommend you are familiar with:
- Basic knowledge of Fused, Python & some geospatial concepts like spatial joins & aggregation.

{/* TODO: Link to pricing page once we have it */}
Different Fused accounts will allow you to:

| Feature | Guest (Free) | Personal (Free) | Team (and above) |
|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| Access data | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Run public UDF code | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Edit & replicate code | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

{/* TODO: Uncomment below line + Link to pricing page once we have it */}
{/* Read more about the different Fused account types */}

## What you'll learn

- When to use H3 Hexagons to simplify & speed up your analysis
- How to do simple aggregations & spatial joins of H3 data to answer questions
- [DuckDB with Fused](/user-guide/in/duckdb/)
- Display your results
- Use advanced Fused concepts like caching, [parallel computing](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#running-multiple-jobs-in-parallel) with [`fused.submit()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#submit)
