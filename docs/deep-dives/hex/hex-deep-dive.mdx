# H3 Hexagons Deep Dive

![Open Water in US from CDL](/img/deep-dives/hex/Open_waters_US_from_CDL.png)

_We'll show you how to manipulate huge datasets with H3 & Fused like this example: Crop Data Layer filtered to only show open waters in the US_

{/* TODO: Needs an intro to what this deep dive will cover:
- Using data on Source Coop so anyone can access it
- Writing UDFs that can aggregate & join different datasets
 */}

## What you'll learn

[Hexagons are the bestagons](https://youtu.be/thOifuHs6eY?si=UKeC4tEcUGxflLro), especially for analysing large datasets. We think so, and we'll show you: 

- When to use H3 Hexagons to simplify & speed up your analysis
- How to do simple aggregations & spatial joins of H3 data to answer questions
- Using [DuckDB with Fused](/user-guide/in/duckdb/) for fast queries
- Ways to display your results
- Use advanced Fused concepts like [caching](/core-concepts/cache/), [parallel computing](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#running-multiple-jobs-in-parallel) with [`fused.submit()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#submit)


## Prerequisites

**Knowledge**

It will be helpful if you have some familiarity with:
- Fused, Python
- Some geospatial concepts like spatial joins & aggregation.

We'll do our best to explain all the Fused concepts and any operations we do. If you ever have questions, reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fused) or send an email to `info@fused.io` if you get stuck!

**Access**
{/* TODO: Link to pricing page once we have it */}
Different Fused accounts will allow you to:

| Feature | Guest (Free) | Personal (Free) | Team (and above) |
|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| Access data | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Run public UDF code | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit & replicate code | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

{/* TODO: Uncomment below line + Link to pricing page once we have it */}
{/* Read more about the different Fused account types */}
