# Ingesting Datasets into H3

🚧 This section is still a Work in Progress 🚧 

This section will cover:
- How to ingest data (points or raster) into H3 cells

For the rest of this guide we'll be using data already ingested into H3 cells, and available on [Source Cooperative](https://source.coop/repositories/fused/hex/description). 

Source Cooperative is a free repository of data, handled & managed by the Radiant Earth Foundation. [Fused simply provides](/blog/cdl-census-hex/) a partitioned & H3 tiled version of the USDA's Crop Data Layer & US Census data.
