## General questions



<details>
<summary>Whom is Fused for?</summary>

Fused is designed for teams seeking to simplify their workflows and accelerate the creation and delivery of data products. It's ideal for organizations that need a scalable solution to handle growing data sizes while minimizing the time spent on data engineering.
</details>



<details>
<summary>Why Python, when there's spatial SQL?</summary>

Python is the go-to language for spatial data science. Although spatial SQL joins and transformations can be efficiently performed using PostGIS in an external database, you may eventually need to convert that data to Pandas and NumPy for further processing and analysis, especially for detailed operations on raster arrays. Additionally, you can run SQL directly on Fused using Python libraries like DuckDB, combining the strengths of both approaches.

<details>
<summary>What's the benefit of geo partitioning vector tables?</summary>

It enables efficient reading of large datasets by strategically partitioning GeoParquet files. Fused's GeoParquet format includes metadata that allows for spatial filtering of any dataset, loading only the chunks relevant to a specific area of interest. This approach reduces memory usage and allows you to work with any size dataset with just Python.

<details>
<summary>Which authentication methods do you support?</summary>

Fused currently uses Auth0 to support authentication via Google and GitHub.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the best way to create a map from my UDF data and share it with external teams?</summary>

You can use the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/app-overview/) create an app that loads the UDF's data then [create a shareable link](/workbench/app-builder/app-overview/#share).

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I create a set of tiles that cover a given geometry?</summary>

Use cases like creating chips may call for running a UDF across a set of tiles that fall within a given geometry. This can be done by creating a list of tiles with the [mercantile](https://github.com/mapbox/mercantile) library then calling the UDF [in parallel](/user-guide/examples/zonal-stats/#c-parallelization).

```python showLineNumbers
import fused
import mercantile

bounds = [32.4203, -14.0933, 34.6186, -12.42826]

tile_list = list(mercantile.tiles(*bounds,zooms=[15]))
```

### Common Errors

<details>
<summary>Error: `Access is not configured for you in the Fused Workbench. Please refresh the page if you think this is an error, or get in touch if you require further help. Cause: Realtime instance not configured.`</summary>

This error occurs when you try to run a UDF with an account associated with a workspace environment that does not have a realtime instance configured. This means that there are no worker nodes available to run the UDF. To resolve this issue, please get in touch with the Fused team team to ensure your account is associated with an environment with a realtime instance.

When Troubleshooting this error, it may help to navigate to your account's User Profile page to determine if the account is associated with an environment and realtime instance, as shown here.

</details>



<details>
<summary>Error: `No such file or directory: '/mnt/cache/'`</summary>

This error occurs when a UDF attempts to access the [`/mnt/cache` disk](/core-concepts/content-management/file-system/#mntcache-disk) when it is not available for the environment. To resolve this issue, please contact the Fused team to ensure that the cache directory is available for your account.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Error: `No space left on the device: '/tmp/'`</summary>

This error occurs when a UDF attempts to write more data than the `/tmp` directory of the real-time instance can handle. Realtime instances have a limited amount of space available and are ephemeral between runs. You might want to consider writing to [`/mnt/cache` disk](/core-concepts/content-management/file-system/#mntcache-disk) instead.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Error: `Quota limit: Number of running instances`</summary>

Fused batch jobs, which are initiated with [run_remote](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#jobrun_remote), require a server quota to be enabled for your account. These include data [ingestion](/core-concepts/data-ingestion/) jobs. If you encounter this error, please contact the Fused team to request an increase in the quota allotted to your account.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Error: `Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see browser console for more information).`</summary>

In the case that you encounter this error, please reset your browser cache and cookies. If the error persists, please contact the Fused team for further assistance.
</details>


<details>
<summary>Error: `MY_UDF... not saved because a UDF or app wit that name already exists.`</summary>

It's possible you might be editing a "local" UDF that has the same name as a Team UDF. To resolve this issue, you can either rename the UDF or, if your intention is to update the Team UDF, [Push it to GitHub](/workbench/udf-catalog/#publish-a-udf-to-a-github-repository).

</details>


<details>
<summary>Error: `Failed to create share token: {"detail":"UDF not found"}`</summary>

To resolve this error, save the UDF again and refreshing your browser window. If the problem persists, rename the UDF and try again.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'geopandas'`</summary>

This error means the required Python package isnâ€™t installed in the environment. To fix this, install the package using `micropip` at the top of your UDF:

```
import micropip
await micropip.install(['geopandas'])
import geopandas as gpd
```


You can install multiple packages the same way:
```
await micropip.install(['geopandas', 'pandas', 'numpy'])
```
