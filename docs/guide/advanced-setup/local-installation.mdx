# Python installation

Install and set up the Fused Python SDK on your local machine.

:::info
This section is only for local environments outside of Fused. If you're working in [Workbench](/workbench/overview), `fused` is already installed for you.
:::

> The latest version of `fused` is <FusedVersionLive />.

:::note
Installing `fused` is required if you're running Fused locally or in a development environment. If you're working in [Workbench](/workbench/overview), `fused` is already installed for you.
:::

## Install

**Python Version:** 3.10+

```bash
pip install "fused[all]"
```

<details>
<summary>Installation options</summary>

1. Set up a Python environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install the `fused` package:

```bash
# Base package only
pip install fused

# For raster data processing
pip install "fused[raster]"

# For vector data processing
pip install "fused[vector]"

# All optional dependencies (recommended)
pip install "fused[all]"
```

</details>

## Authenticate

The first time you use Fused locally, you'll need to authenticate. This stores credentials in `~/.fused/credentials`.

<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
  <TabItem value="notebook" label="Notebook" default>

    ```python
    from fused.api import NotebookCredentials
    credentials = NotebookCredentials()
    ```

    Follow the URL in your browser to authenticate.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="script" label="Python Script">

    ```python
    from fused.api import NotebookCredentials

    credentials = NotebookCredentials()
    print(credentials.url)
    ```

    Follow the URL in your browser to authenticate.

    :::info
    When running code from a Python environment without browser access, you may copy the `~/.fused/credentials` file to the same location in the target system.
    :::

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Log out

Log out the current user. This deletes the credentials saved to disk.

```python
import fused
fused.api.logout()
```

## Get Bearer token

Get your account's Bearer (Access) token for [authenticating API requests](/guide/data-input-outputs/export-api/tokens-endpoints).

```python
import fused
fused.api.access_token()
```

:::warning
Do not share your Bearer token. It allows impersonation of your account.
:::

## Quick test

Verify your installation works:

```python
import fused

@fused.udf
def udf():
    return "Hello from Fused!"

fused.run(udf)
```
