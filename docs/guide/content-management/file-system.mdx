Fused provides two file systems to make files accessible to all UDFs: an [S3 bucket](#fd-s3-bucket) and a [disk](#mntcache-disk). Access is scoped at the organization level.

## `fd://` S3 bucket

Fused provisions a private S3 bucket namespace for your organization. It's ideal for large-scale, cloud-native, or globally accessible datasets, such as ingested tables, GeoTIFFs, and files that need to be read outside of Fused.

Use the [File explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/) to browse the bucket and see its full path.

Fused utility functions may reference it with the `fd://` alias.

```python showLineNumbers
job = fused.ingest(
    input="https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/STATE/06_CALIFORNIA/06/tl_rd22_06_bg.zip",
    output="fd://census/ca_bg_2022/",
).run_batch()
```

## `/mnt/cache` disk

`/mnt/cache` is the path to a mounted disk to store files shared between UDFs. This is where `@fused.cache` and [`fused.download`](/guide/content-management/download) write data. It's ideal for files that UDFs need to read with low-latency, downloaded files, the output of cached functions, access keys, `.env`, and ML model weights.

UDFs may interact with the disk as with a local file system. For example, to list files in the directory:

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import os
    for each in os.listdir('/mnt/cache/'):
        print(each)
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter the following error, it means `/mnt/cache` is not yet configured for your environment. To resolve this issue, please contact the Fused team to enable it.

```text
Error: No such file or directory: '/mnt/cache/'
```
