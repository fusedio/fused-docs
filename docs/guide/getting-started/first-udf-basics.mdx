# First UDF & Basics

## Fused

Fused makes it easy to run Python at scale. You write Python code, and Fused handles execution, scaling, and API generation automatically.

It decouples *what you write* from *how it runs* and *where it goes*.

## UDFs

UDFs (User Defined Functions) are Python functions with a `@fused.udf` decorator that return data. Each UDF becomes its own API endpoint with a unique URL.

```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.DataFrame({"greeting": ["Hello, World!"]})
```

That's it. Save this in [Workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench) and it's deployed.

## Data

Bring your own data into Fused:

- **Drag & drop** — Drop local files directly into Workbench
- **Cloud storage** — Read from S3, GCS, or Azure (public or [connect your own bucket](/guide/working-with-data/data-connections/))
- **APIs** — Fetch from any HTTP endpoint

```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.read_csv("s3://your-bucket/your-data.csv")
```

## Formats

Same UDF, multiple output formats. Change the URL extension to get JSON, CSV, Parquet, PNG, TIFF, or MVT — no code changes needed.

```
https://udf.ai/YOUR_TOKEN.json
https://udf.ai/YOUR_TOKEN.csv
https://udf.ai/YOUR_TOKEN.parquet
```

Pass parameters via URL to change outputs dynamically:

```
https://udf.ai/YOUR_TOKEN.json?my_param=value
```

Learn more about the [Dynamic File API](/guide/data-input-outputs/export-api/dynamic-file-api).

## Caching

First request runs your code. Subsequent requests (same code, same parameters) return cached results in under a second.

You control cache duration per UDF. Learn more about [caching](/guide/performance/caching/).

## Pipelines

UDFs can call other UDFs with `fused.run()` to build data pipelines. Each stays standalone with its own endpoint.

```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    # Call another UDF by name
    upstream_data = fused.run('my_other_udf')
    return upstream_data.head(10)
```

Organise UDFs visually in [Canvas](/workbench/udf-builder/canvas/) — connect them, build workflows, create dashboards.
