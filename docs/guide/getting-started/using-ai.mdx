# Using AI

AI is built into Workbench to help you write, edit, and debug UDFs. There are 2 main ways to use AI in Fused:

- [**AI Chat**](#ai-chat) for large changes
- [**Inline Edit**](#inline-edit) for small quick edits

For more details, tips, and video tutorials, see the [AI Chat](/workbench/ai-chat/) reference.

## AI Chat

Open AI Chat to make large changes to your UDF or start from scratch.

![AI Chat is associated with the currently selected UDF, not the whole canvas.](/img/quickstart/ai_tab_associated_to_udf.png)

**Good for:**
- Rewriting or restructuring entire UDFs (for example, joining datasets with complex queries)
- Customizing templates (like [standalone maps](/examples/standalone-html-maps) or [charts](/examples/creating-charts))
- Getting feedback on your code & asking questions about your data

## Inline Edit

Use inline edit for quick, targeted changes to specific code sections.

**Good for:**
- Small edits when you know exactly what needs to change (filtering, simple joins, etc.)
- When you know exactly what needs to change, but don't want to rewrite the entire UDF

## Handling Changes

AI changes are shown as a green/red diff. Changes are applied by default, but you control what to accept or reject.

## Error Summaries

When a UDF errors, Fused provides an AI-generated summary explaining the issue.

For [**realtime UDFs**](/guide/working-with-udfs/udf-best-practices/realtime), you also get two fix options:
- **Deep Fix** — Opens AI Chat for larger changes
- **Quick Fix** — Inline edit on the lines around the error

For [**dedicated jobs**](/guide/working-with-udfs/udf-best-practices/scaling-out#dedicated-instances), only the error summary is shown.
