# Using AI

AI is built into Workbench to help you write, edit, and debug UDFs.

## AI Tab

Open the AI Tab to make large changes to your UDF or start from scratch.

![The AI Tab is associated with the currently selected UDF, not the whole canvas.](/img/quickstart/ai_tab_associated_to_udf.png)

**Good for:**
- Rewriting or restructuring entire UDFs
- Leveraging templates (shareable HTML maps, dashboards)
- Accessing utility libraries (`common`, `map_utils`, `message_utils`)

## Inline Edit

Use inline edit for quick, targeted changes to specific code sections.

**Good for:**
- Small edits when you know exactly what needs to change
- Example: After loading 2 datasets, ask it to join them

:::note Per-UDF Scope
Both AI Tab and Inline Edit work on the currently selected UDF, not canvas-wide.

## Handling Changes

AI changes are shown as a green/red diff. Changes are applied by default, but you control what to accept or reject.

## Error Summaries

When a UDF errors, Fused explains the issue and offers two options:

- **Deep Fix** — Opens AI Tab for larger changes
- **Quick Fix** — Inline edit on the lines around the error
