# Workbench Intro 

Workbench is Fused's browser based IDE. 

![Workbench Preview](/img/workbench/workbench_preview.png)

It allows you to:
- Write Python UDFs directly in the browser — no setup needed
- Build workflows and shareable dashboards in [Canvas](#canvas)
- Browse cloud storage and preview files in [File Explorer](#file-explorer)

## Canvas

Freeform canvas where each UDF is a draggable card. Connect UDFs with the (+) icon to build workflows, annotate with text elements, and create interactive dashboards shareable via link.

_An example of a workflow in Canvas: Change the crop type to see the changes in the dataframe and map. [Try it out →](https://unstable.fused.io/canvas/fc_4Dr6z6OuYHboSbs3VbpdEc)_

**Good for:**
- Chaining UDFs together into repeatable workflows
- Annotating work with text elements next to code
- Creating interactive dashboards shareable with a link

## File Explorer

Browse public or private cloud storage buckets. Preview large files directly in the browser, then double-click to open in a UDF and start working.

**Good for:**
- Browsing files across different buckets (S3, GCS)
- Previewing large files without writing code
- Quickly opening files in a UDF template

## UDF Builder (Advanced)

A GIS-style layer view for advanced geospatial exploration. Toggle UDFs on/off like layers in QGIS/ArcGIS, with automatic tiling for large datasets based on the viewport.

![UDF Builder](/img/workbench/udf_builder_preview.png)

**Good for:**
- Advanced exploration of large geospatial datasets
- Working across multiple layers (each UDF is a layer)
- Automatic viewport-based tiling for performance
