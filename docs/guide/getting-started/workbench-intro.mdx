# Workbench Intro 

Workbench is Fused's browser based IDE. 

![Workbench Preview](/img/workbench/workbench_preview.png)

It allows you to:
- Write UDFs directly in the browser, writing Python without any setup and with direct access to cloud data
- Chain UDFs together easily in [Canvas](#canvas)
- Explore datasets in [File Explorer](#file-explorer)

## Canvas

Freeform canvas where each UDF is a draggable card. Connect UDFs with the (+) icon to build workflows, annotate with text elements, and create interactive dashboards shareable via link.

**Good for:**
- Chaining UDFs together into repeatable workflows
- Annotating work with text elements next to code
- Creating interactive dashboards shareable with a link

## File Explorer

Browse public or private cloud storage buckets. Preview large files directly in the browser, then double-click to open in a UDF and start working.

![File Explorer](/img/workbench/file_explorer_preview.png)

**Good for:**
- Browsing files across different buckets (S3, GCS)
- Previewing large files without writing code
- Quickly opening files in a UDF template

## UDF Builder (Advanced)

A GIS-style layer view for advanced geospatial exploration. Toggle UDFs on/off like layers in QGIS/ArcGIS, with automatic tiling for large datasets based on the viewport.

![UDF Builder](/img/workbench/udf_builder_preview.png)

**Good for:**
- Advanced exploration of large geospatial datasets
- Working across multiple layers (each UDF is a layer)
- Automatic viewport-based tiling for performance
