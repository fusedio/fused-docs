# Converting to H3

This page has been split into:

- **[Raster to H3](/guide/h3-analytics/raster-to-h3)** — Large raster ingestion with `run_ingest_raster_to_h3`, metrics, partitioning. Examples: Copernicus DEM, gSSURGO, CDL.
- **[Vector to H3](/guide/h3-analytics/vector-to-h3)** — Points (File to H3), polygons and raster tiles (Dynamic Tile), and large vector (`.map()`). Example: GridMET pipeline.

See the [Overview](/guide/h3-analytics/h3-overview#converting-datasets-to-h3-tiles) table for a quick comparison.
