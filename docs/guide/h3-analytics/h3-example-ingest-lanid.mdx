# Example: Ingest LANID (irrigation)

Land irrigation (LANID) data is often distributed as rasters or vectors. Once converted to H3 (e.g. via [Raster to H3](/guide/h3-analytics/raster-to-h3) or a custom pipeline), read it by bounds for analysis.

## Read

Pre-ingested LANID hex data (e.g. at `s3://fused-asset/misc/hex/irr_lanid_out/`) can be read with a hex reader that supports bounds + resolution. Filter by `data == 1` for irrigated, `data == 0` for non-irrigated:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(
    bounds: fused.types.Bounds = [-121.525, 37.70, -120.96, 38.06],
    irrigated: bool = True,
    hex_res: int = 7,
):
    path = "s3://fused-asset/misc/hex/irr_lanid_out/"
    # Use a reader that supports your LANID hex layout (e.g. read_hex_table or read_h3_dataset)
    # df = reader.read_hex_table(bounds, path, hex_res=hex_res)
    # df = df[df["data"] == irrigated]
    return df
```

Use this layer in [Joining](/guide/h3-analytics/joining#example-joining-env-variables) with CDL, soil, and GridMET.
