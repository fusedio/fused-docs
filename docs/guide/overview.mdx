# Fused Guide Overview

At Fused, we’re building an analytics platform where context-rich data, real-time execution, and human insight come together to make AI more accurate, useful, and aligned with how analysts actually work.
{/* TODO: rephrase above later */}

Read more about our vision [here](/blog/analytics-is-changing/).

Fused brings together:
- **[Multi-Processing](/guide/working-with-udfs/writing-udfs/)**: Real-time Python engine for immediate Python runtime
- **[AI Editor](/workbench/ai-assistant/)**: Unlike AI code editors, Fused has access to your data's structure and context
- **[Visualization](/examples/creating-charts)**: Create dashboards & graphs with your data in seconds

Imagine a data engine, code editor & business intelligence all in one.
