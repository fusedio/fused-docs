# Running UDFs

UDFs really shine once you start calling them from anywhere. There are two main execution modes:

| Mode | Timeout | Resources | Best For |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|
| [**Realtime**](/guide/running-udfs/realtime) | 120 seconds | Standard | Interactive queries, APIs, dashboards |
| [**Batch Jobs**](/guide/running-udfs/batch-jobs) | Hours | Configurable | Large datasets, ingestion, heavy processing |

---

## Quick Start

### Run from Python

```python
import fused

# Run any saved UDF
result = fused.run("My_UDF_Name")

# Run a public UDF
result = fused.run("UDF_Single_point_Eiffel_Tower")
```

### Run via HTTPS

Every saved UDF gets an endpoint:

```
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_***/run/file?format=json
```

Use this in dashboards, notebooks, or any HTTP client.

## Choosing an Execution Mode

| Scenario | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| Quick data fetch | Realtime |
| Interactive map tiles | Realtime |
| API endpoint for apps | Realtime |
| Processing >1000 files | Batch Job |
| Memory >8GB required | Batch Job |
| Running >2 minutes | Batch Job |

## Next Steps

| Topic | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-------------------|
| [Realtime Execution](/guide/running-udfs/realtime) | `fused.run()`, HTTPS endpoints, tokens |
| [Batch Jobs](/guide/running-udfs/batch-jobs) | `run_batch()`, instance types, logs |
| [Parallel Processing](/guide/running-udfs/parallel-processing) | `fused.submit()` for many tasks |
| [HTTP Endpoints](/guide/running-udfs/http-endpoints) | Parameters, tiling, serialization |
