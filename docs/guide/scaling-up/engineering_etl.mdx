# Connect your data to Fused

## Connect your own data sources

You can directly connect your data buckets to Fused:
- [AWS S3](/workbench/file-explorer/#amazon-s3)
- [Google Cloud Storage](/workbench/file-explorer/#google-cloud-storage-gcs)
- [GCP BigQuery](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/gee_bigquery/#bigquery)
- [Google Earth Engine](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/gee_bigquery/#google-earth-engine)
- [Snowflake](/tutorials/load-export-data/#snowflake)

## Bring data directly inside Fused

Quickly bring any data not on the cloud into Fused:

1. Drag & Drop in [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/)!

![Drag and drop files directly into Workbench](/img/tutorials/drag_and_drop.gif)

2. Use [`fused.upload()`](/reference/python-sdk/api-reference/api/#upload)

[Install `fused`](/reference/python-sdk/#python-install) Python, [authenticate](/reference/python-sdk/authentication/#authenticate) & run:

```python
fused.api.upload("my_local_file.csv", "fd://my_data/file.csv")
```

Note: [`fd://`](/core-concepts/content-management/file-system/#fd-s3-bucket) is the [Fused provisioned private S3 path](/core-concepts/content-management/file-system/#fd-s3-bucket) for your team.


## Optimize data loading

For files < 1GB:

Leverage [caching](/core-concepts/cache/#caching-basics) built in to Fused to make loading any data faster:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path: str = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd
    
    @fused.cache
    def load_data(path):
        return pd.read_csv(path)

    # Some processing 
    
    return load_data(path)
```

- As you make changes inside your UDF, `load_data()` will be [called from cache](/core-concepts/cache/#caching-any-python-function-fusedcache).
- This is especially useful for slow formats (CSV, Excel, etc.) or files that are not partitioned well.

For files > 1GB:

Use [`fused.ingest()`](/reference/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedingest) to ingest large datasets into cloud optimized, partitioned files.

```python
job = fused.ingest(
    input="https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/LAYER/TRACT/tl_rd22_11_tract.zip",
    output=f"s3://fused-users/{user_id}/census/dc_tract/",
)

job.run_batch()
```

## Infrastructure (Github / Secrets / On Prem)

You can use Fused with your own infrastructure:
- Allow your team to save UDFs in [your own Github repo](/core-concepts/content-management/git/)
- Save & access [secrets](/reference/workbench/preferences#secrets-management) in Fused
- Use Fused on [your own servers](/core-concepts/onprem/) (On prem option)

## Examples

- [Ingesting ship transponder](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/use-cases/dark-vessel-detection/#3-ingesting-ais-data) data in fused
