# Scaling Up

Techniques for handling large datasets and improving performance.

## Topics

| Topic | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-------------------|
| [Caching](/guide/scaling-up/cache) | Speed up repeated operations |
| [Realtime Execution](/guide/running-udfs/realtime) | Run UDFs via Python or HTTPS |
| [Batch Jobs](/guide/running-udfs/batch-jobs) | Process large datasets |
| [fused.submit()](/reference/python-sdk/top-level-functions#fusedsubmit) | Run many tasks concurrently |

## Quick Wins

### Cache Expensive Operations

```python
@fused.cache
def load_data(path):
    return pd.read_parquet(path)
```

### Run in Parallel

```python
results = fused.submit(my_udf, range(100))
```

### Use Bigger Instances

```python
@fused.udf(instance_type="large")
def big_job():
    # Memory-intensive work
    ...
```

## When to Scale

| Scenario | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Same data loaded repeatedly | Use `@fused.cache` |
| Many independent tasks | Use `fused.submit()` |
| Single large dataset | Use `fused.ingest()` |
| Memory-intensive processing | Use larger instance type |
