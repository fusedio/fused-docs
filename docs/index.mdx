# Welcome to Fused

### **Why Fused**

Modern data science applications require datasets measured in 100s or 1,000s of Gb, combining many different sources and formats all together. But the analysis is as slow as the slowest process.

Fused is an end-to-end cloud platform for data analytics, build around [User Defined Functions](/core-concepts/why/) (UDFs): Python functions that can be run via HTTP requests from anywhere, without any install required.

### **Fused Features**

To speed up Data Science pipelines we need a few things, all of which we're working on:
- [Ingestion of data](/core-concepts/data_ingestion/) into Cloud Native formats
- [Serverless compute engine](/core-concepts/write/) for User Defined Functions
- [Caching of data](/core-concepts/content-management/cache/) for faster iteration & reducing cost of compute
- [Workbench](/workbench/overview/) our browser-based IDE to develop & iterate on UDFs with a map view
- [Batch run](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run_large/) of many User Defined Functions to scale code to any dataset size in a few lines of code

### Getting started

To get your hands dirty with Fused:

- [âš¡ Quickstart Guide](/quickstart/): Learn the basics of Fused with a simple example in just a few minutes
- [Core-Concepts](/core-concepts/) of Fused UDFs (writing & running) 
- [Examples](/user-guide/examples/): Building full pipelines with ingestion, writing more complex UDFs, running & deploying them
