# AI, with all your data's context

At Fused, we’re building an analytics platform where context-rich data, real-time execution, and human insight come together to make AI more accurate, useful, and aligned with how analysts actually work.

Fused brings together:
- **[Multi-Processing](/core-concepts/write/)**: Real-time Python engine for immediate Python runtime
- **[AI Editor](/workbench/ai-assistant/)**: Unlike AI code editors, Fused has access to your data's structure and context
- **[Visualization](/quickstart/#vibe-coding-a-dashboard)**: Create dashboards & graphs with your data in seconds

Imagine a data engine, code editor & business intelligence all in one.
