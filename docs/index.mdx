# Meet Fused

Fused Workbench is an end-to-end cloud platform for data analytics. Fused revolves around Python functions that can be called via HTTP requests, called User Defined Functions ([UDFs](/core-concepts/why/)).

## First look

User Defined Functions are Python functions that run on the Fused backend with a HTTP endpoint. Here's an example:

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import geopandas as gpd
    import requests
    
    DATASET = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-visualization/folium-example-data/main/subway_stations.geojson'
    return gpd.GeoDataFrame.from_features(requests.get(DATASET).json())
```

### Running a User Defined Function

The simplest place to edit a User Defined Function is on [the Fused workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench), a browser based IDE:

You can also write & run any UDF locally, you don't _need_ the Fused Workbench IDE

### Share your User Defined Function

```python showLineNumbers
import fused
fused.run("YOUR_HASH") # Can we get this from fused-py directly, or do we need to use workbench?
```

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'
