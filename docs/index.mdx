# Welcome to Fused

### **Why Fused**

Modern data science applications require datasets measured in 100s or 1,000s of Gb, combining many different sources and formats all together. 

But the analysis is as slow as the slowest process.

Fused is an end-to-end cloud platform for data analytics, build around [User Defined Functions](/core-concepts/why/) (UDFs): Python functions that can be run via HTTP requests from anywhere, without any install required.

### **Fused Features**

To speed up Data Science pipelines we need a few things, all of which we're working on:
- [Ingestion of data](/core-concepts/content-management/Ingest/) into Cloud Native formats
- [Serverless compute engine](/core-concepts/write/) for User Defined Functions
- [Caching of data](/core-concepts/content-management/cache/) for faster iteration while developing
{/*  TODO: Uncomment this when we have a page for batch process */}
{/* - Batch run of many User Defined Functions to scale code to any dataset in a few lines of code */}

### Getting started

To get your hands dirty with Fused:
