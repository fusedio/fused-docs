# Meet Fused

Fused is a cloud platform to build end to end data apps. Fused's 4 products revolve around the User Defined Function ([UDF](/core-concepts/why/)), which are Python functions that can be called via HTTP requests.

- Browse datasets in cloud storage with the [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/)
- The [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) is where you [write](/core-concepts/write/) UDFs to transform data
- The [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/) turns UDFs into interactive shareable apps
- Share and discover UDFs in the [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog/)

Read how to [get started](/user-guide/quickstart/) in minutes or jump right into the Workbench at [fused.io/workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench).


## Why Fused?

As datasets and apps grow in size and complexity, traditional methods become increasingly impractical for the needs of industry. Fused simplifies how you build and share powerful workflows in the form of apps and HTTP endpoints.

UDFs are composable building blocks to load and transform data across a range of applications. They can be used as virtual datasets, file readers, and tasks. This makes data workflows and apps easy to scale, share, and integrate.

This diagram shows how UDFs can be used to link upstream datasets with downstream data platforms.
