# Meet Fused

Fused Workbench is a cloud platform to build end-to-end data apps. Fused revolves around User Defined Function ([UDFs](/core-concepts/why/)), which are Python functions that can be called via HTTP requests.

_This diagram illustrates how UDFs can link upstream datasets with downstream data platforms._


## Why Fused?


There is currently no comprehensive tool for data scientists to perform their job end-to-end. Gaps exist in how data is discovered, accessed, and explored. Writing code to load and transform data can be repetitive, and reusing and sharing this code can be challenging. Furthermore, creating apps to deliver results to stakeholders can be time consuming and often requires juggling multiple frameworks.

Fused simplifies the process of building and sharing powerful end-to-end data analysis workflows. UDFs act as composable building blocks that can be called by various applications to load and transform data. They can function as virtual datasets, file readers, and tasks - making analytics easier to scale, share, and integrate.

Workbench integrates the following products to work with data and build apps using UDFs.

- You use [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/) to browse and preview files in cloud storage
- [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) is where you write UDFs to transform data
- In the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/) you create and share apps that interact with UDFs
- The [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog/) is where you share and discover UDFs
