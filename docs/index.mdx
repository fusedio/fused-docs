# Meet Fused

Fused is a cloud platform to build end-to-end data apps. Fused revolves around the User Defined Function ([UDF](/core-concepts/why/)), which are Python functions that can be called via HTTP requests.

- You use [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/) to browse and preview files in cloud storage
- [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) is where you write UDFs to transform data
- In the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/) you create and share apps that interact with UDFs
- The [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog/) is where you share and discover UDFs



These products come together to create end-to-end data apps.

[Get started](/user-guide/quickstart/) or jump right into the Workbench at [fused.io/workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench).


## Why Fused?

Fused simplifies the process of building and sharing powerful workflows through apps and HTTP endpoints.


UDFs serve as composable building blocks for loading and transforming data across a variety of applications. They can function as virtual datasets, file readers, and tasks, making data workflows and apps easier to scale, share, and integrate.

This diagram illustrates how UDFs can link upstream datasets with downstream data platforms.
