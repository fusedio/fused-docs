# Meet Fused

Fused [Workbench](/workbench) is an end-to-end cloud platform for data analytics. 

The core feature behind Fused are Python functions that can be run via HTTP requests, called **User Defined Functions ([UDFs](/core-concepts/why/))**. You can run these UDFs and retrieve data from it from anywhere you can call a HTTP endpoint.

## First look

_We're going to create a simple UDF and return it's results in a Google Sheet. Feel free to follow along by [first making sure you can login](/user-guide/login)._ 

As an example, we're going to load New York City metro station, taken from a GeoJSON directly hosted on Github [from the `folium-example-data` public repo](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium-example-data). 

We are going to simply open this GeoJSON as a `GeoDataFrame` object using [`geopandas`, a geospatial Python library](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) similar to [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/#), with the handy addition of a `geometry` column that holds spatial information (in our case the latitude / longitude of all our stations):

{/*  This section doesn't fully acknowledge that you need to pip install fused if you want to run this locally or that workbench is required.  */}
```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import geopandas as gpd
    
    return gpd.read_file(
        'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-visualization/folium-example-data/main/subway_stations.geojson'
    )
```

All you need to make a Python function a Fused UDF is to add the `@fused.udf()` decorator to it.

You'll also note that we do our imports _inside_ the UDF. We'll touch on that in a later section.
{/* <!-- #TODO: Actually, you know, touch on that later --> */}

### Running your first User Defined Function

The simplest place to edit a UDF is on [the Fused workbench](/workbench), a browser based IDE. 
Check out the [Login page to get access](/user-guide/login). 

![First Look Fused Workbench](./index-imgs/Workbench-first-look.png) 

Fused Workbench runs your UDF in real-time. You don't need to execute your code, it's always running! 

Here's are the main elements of Workbench:
1. Our UDF script in the UDF Builder
2. The NYC subway stations from the geodataframe in the Map View
3. We don't have any errors in the Results Page

:::info

You can also write & run any UDF in your preferred Python environment - the Fused Workbench IDE isn't strictly required. 

We'll show how to run your UDF in workbench for now, as that's the simplest way to get started

### Share your User Defined Function

One of the most powerful aspects of Fused is that each UDF can be shared, as a HTTP endpoint. 

Here's how to return our `GeoDataFrame` from the UDF defined in Workbench to Google Sheets:

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

<ReactPlayer className="video__player" playing={false} muted={true} controls height="100%" url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/docs_rewrite/share_udf_to_sheets_updated.mp4" width="100%" />


## Next Steps

{/*
#TODO: Update links once the docs are updated with new structure
#TODO #2: We don't have a page dedicated to workbench
*/}
This should give you a first taste of what Fused is. For more, check out:
- Our [quick start example](/user-guide/quickstart) that walks you through a full end-to-end data science example
- Get to know what [UDF, User Defined Functions, are in more depth](/core-concepts/why)
- Become more familiar with the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/), the browser based IDE (no install required!)
- Deep dive into `fused-py`, [how to use it locally and everything you can do with it](/python-sdk)
