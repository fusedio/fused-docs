# Meet Fused

Fused Workbench is an end-to-end cloud platform for data analytics. Fused revolves around User Defined Function ([UDFs](/core-concepts/why/)), which are Python functions that can be called via HTTP requests.

## Why Fused?


There is currently no comprehensive tool for data scientists to perform their job end-to-end. The modern data stack still has gaps in how data is discovered, accessed, and explored. Writing code to load and transform data can be repetitive. Reusing and sharing code across teams and projects presents its challenges. Creating apps to deliver results to stakeholders can be time consuming and often involves multiple frameworks.

Fused simplifies the process of building and sharing powerful end-to-end data analysis workflows. Fused advances UDFs as composable building blocks that can be called by applications via HTTP calls to load and transform data. As such, UDFs can act as virtual datasets, file readers, and tasks - making analytics easier to scale, share, and integrate.

Workbench consists of the following integrated products designed to enhance how you work with data.

- You use [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/) to browse and preview files in cloud storage
- [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) is where you write UDFs to transform data
- In the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/) you create and share apps that interact with UDFs
- The [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog/) is where you share and discover UDFs
