# AI, with all your data context.

AI with all your data context.

Fused brings together:
- **Multi-Processing**: Real Time Python engine for immediate python runtime
- **AI Editor**: Unlike AI code editors, Fused has access to your data's structure and context
- **Visualization**: Create dashboard & graphs with your data in seconds

<img src="/img/fused_overview_v2.jpeg" alt="Fused Overview" style={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '800px', display: 'block', margin: '20px auto'}}/>

Imagine a data engine, code editor & business intelligence all in one.

{/* Fused is an end-to-end cloud platform for data analytics, build around [User Defined Functions](/core-concepts/why/) (UDFs): Python functions that can be run via HTTP requests from anywhere, without any install required. */}

### **Fused Features**

To speed up Data Science pipelines we need a few things, all of which we're working on:
- [Ingestion of data](/core-concepts/data-ingestion/) into Cloud Native formats
- [Serverless compute engine](/core-concepts/write/) for fast scaling of your code
- [AI Assistant](/workbench/ai-assistant/) to help you write code, visualize data, and more
