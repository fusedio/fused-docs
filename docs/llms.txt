# Fused

> Fused is serverless engine to make any Python function runnable from anywhere. Fused offers users the ability to write & execute their own User Defined Functions (UDF) and run them from anywhere

When creating Fused UDFs remember to:
- Keep your UDFs to <120s so they run fast on real-time instances
- Type your inputs using Python's built-in typing when defining functions
- Use `fused.submit()` to run UDFs in parallel
- Cache as much as possible. This makes your UDFs faster & more efficient
- Prepare your large datasets by ingesting them
- Look at existing Public UDFs so you don't have to start from scratch 

When debugging UDFs, remember to:
- Use print statements to see intermediate outputs in the Workbench Results tab
- use `time.time()` to see how long different parts of your code take
- Use `return` to see intermediate outputs to debug problematic objects

When creating UDFs in Workbench remember to:
- Use Workbench to visually explore spatial data with Map View
- Format your code for more visibility with Opt + Shift + F (or Alt + Shift + F on Windows/Linux)
- Change the Map View to Satellite / No base map or just vector tiles
- Use the Visualize Tab to highlight your data
- Tilt the mpa view to explore 3D datasets
- Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate even faster. Hit Cmd + K (or Ctrl + K on Windows / Linux)
