# secrets

Access secrets stored in the Fused backend for the current kernel.

```python
import fused

# Access a secret by name
api_key = fused.secrets['MY_API_KEY']
```

## Overview

`fused.secrets` is a `SecretsManager` object that provides access to secrets stored in your Fused account. Secrets are accessed as attributes using dot notation.

Secrets can be managed in [Workbench Settings](https://www.fused.io/workbench#settings) under the "Secrets" tab, or via the API.

## Usage

### Accessing secrets

```python
import fused

@fused.udf
def udf():
    # Access a secret by name
    api_key = fused.secrets['OPENAI_API_KEY']
    
    # Use the secret
    import openai
    client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
    ...
```

## Security notes

- Secrets are stored encrypted in the Fused backend
- Secrets are only accessible within UDFs running on Fused infrastructure
- Secrets are scoped to your account/organization
- Never log or return secret values from UDFs
