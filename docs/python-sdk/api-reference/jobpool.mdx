## JobPool

The `JobPool` class is used to manage, inspect and retrieve results from
submitted jobs from [`fused.submit()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedsubmit).

### cancel

```python
cancel(wait: bool = False)
```

Cancel any pending (not running) tasks.

Note it will not be possible to retry on the same JobPool later.
