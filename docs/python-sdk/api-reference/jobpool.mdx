## JobPool

The `JobPool` class is used to manage, inspect and retrieve results from
submitted jobs from [`fused.submit()`](/python-sdk/api-reference/fused-submit).

### cancel

```python
cancel(wait: bool = False)
```

Cancel any pending (not running) tasks.

Note it will not be possible to retry on the same JobPool later.

---

### retry

```python
retry()
```

Rerun any tasks in error or timeout states. Tasks are rerun in the same pool.

---

### total_time

```python
total_time(since_retry: bool = False) -> timedelta
```

Returns how long the entire job took.

If only partial results are available, returns based on the last task to have been completed.

---

### times

```python
times() -> list[timedelta | None]
```

Time taken for each task.

Incomplete tasks will be reported as None.

---

### done

```python
done() -> bool
```

True if all tasks have finished, regardless of success or failure.

---

### all_succeeded

```python
all_succeeded() -> bool
```

True if all tasks finished with success

---

### any_failed

```python
any_failed() -> bool
```

True if any task finished with an error

---

### any_succeeded

```python
any_succeeded() -> bool
```

True if any task finished with success

---

### arg_df

```python
arg_df()
```

The arguments passed to runs as a DataFrame

---

### status

```python
status()
```

Return a Series indexed by status of task counts

---

### wait

```python
wait()
```

Wait until all jobs are finished

Use fused.options.show.enable_tqdm to enable/disable tqdm.
Use pool.\_wait_sleep to set if sleep should occur while waiting.

---

### tail

```python
tail(stop_on_exception = False)
```

Wait until all jobs are finished, printing statuses as they become available.

This is useful for interactively watching for the state of the pool.

Use pool.\_wait_sleep to set if sleep should occur while waiting.

---

### results

```python
results(return_exceptions = False) -> list[Any]
```

Retrieve all results of the job.

Results are ordered by the order of the args list.

---

### results_now

```python
results_now(return_exceptions = False) -> dict[int, Any]
```

Retrieve the results that are currently done.

Results are indexed by position in the args list.

---

### df

```python
df(
    status_column: str | None = "status",
    result_column: str | None = "result",
    time_column: str | None = "time",
    logs_column: str | None = "logs",
    exception_column: str | None = None,
    include_exceptions: bool = True,
)
```

Get a DataFrame of results as they are currently.
The DataFrame will have columns for each argument passed, and columns for:
`status`, `result`, `time`, `logs` and optionally `exception`.

---

### get_status_df

```python
get_status_df()
```

---

### get_results_df

```python
get_results_df(ignore_exceptions = False)
```

---

### errors

```python
errors() -> dict[int, Exception]
```

Retrieve the results that are currently done and are errors.

Results are indexed by position in the args list.

---

### first_error

```python
first_error() -> Exception | None
```

Retrieve the first (by order of arguments) error result, or None.

---

### logs

```python
logs() -> list[str | None]
```

Logs for each task.

Incomplete tasks will be reported as None.

---

### first_log

```python
first_log() -> str | None
```

Retrieve the first (by order of arguments) logs, or None.

---

### success

```python
success() -> dict[int, Any]
```

Retrieve the results that are currently done and are successful.

Results are indexed by position in the args list.

---

### pending

```python
pending() -> dict[int, Any]
```

Retrieve the arguments that are currently pending and not yet submitted.

---

### running

```python
running() -> dict[int, Any]
```

Retrieve the results that are currently running.

---

### cancelled

```python
cancelled() -> dict[int, Any]
```

Retrieve the arguments that were cancelled and not run.

---

### collect

```python
collect(ignore_exceptions = False, flatten = True)
```

Collect all results into a DataFrame
