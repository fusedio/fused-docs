## Authenticate

Authenticate the Fused [Python SDK](/python-sdk/) in a Python Notebook.

Make sure to have the `fused` package [installed](/python-sdk/#python-install).

```python showLineNumbers
pip install "fused[all]"
```

To use Fused you need to authenticate. The following will store a credentials file in `~/.fused/credentials`:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';


<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
  <TabItem value="notebook" label="Notebook" default>

    In a notebook cell run:

    ```py
    from fused.api import NotebookCredentials
    credentials = NotebookCredentials()
    ```

    Follow the URL in your browser to authenticate.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="script" label="Python Script">

    Run the following: 

    ```python
    from fused.api import NotebookCredentials

    credentials = NotebookCredentials()
    print(credentials.url)
    ```

    And follow the URL in your browser to authenticate.

    :::info
    When running code from a Python environment without browser access, you may copy the `~/.fused/credentials` file to the same location in the target system.
    :::
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Log out

Log out the current user. This deletes the credentials saved to disk and resets the global Fused API.

```python showLineNumbers
import fused
fused.api.logout()
```

## Get Bearer (Access) token

Get the account's Bearer (sometimes referred to as Access) token.

```python showLineNumbers
import fused
fused.api.access_token()
```

This can be helpful when calling UDFs [via HTTP requests](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#private-token) outside of the Fused Python SDK and Workbench to authenticate with the Fused API.

:::warning Do not share your Bearer token

Do not share your Bearer token with anyone. These allow to impersonate your account and should be treated as such.
