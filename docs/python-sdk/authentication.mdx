## Authenticate

Authenticate the Fused [Python SDK](/python-sdk/) in a Python Notebook.

Start by installing [`fused-py`](https://pypi.org/project/fused/).

```python showLineNumbers
# !pip install fused -q
```

When running Fused in a Notebook, you might be prompted to authenticate. Call `NotebookCredentials` in a cell.

```python showLineNumbers
from fused.api import NotebookCredentials

credentials = NotebookCredentials()
```

:::tip Authentication in Python script / from terminal

If you're not in a Jupyter Notebook, you can get the URL you need to authenticate by printing it:

```python showLineNumbers
from fused.api import NotebookCredentials

credentials = NotebookCredentials()
print(credentials.url)
```

Follow the URL in your browser to authenticate.

:::


Complete the authentication flow and paste the provided credentials snippet in a new cell.

```
credentials.finalize(code="...")
```

Fused will write credentials to disk (in `~/.fused/credentials`) and `fused-py` will have access to the Fused API.

:::info
When running code from a Python environment without browser access, you may copy the `~/.fused/credentials` file to the same location in the target system.
:::

## Log out

Log out the current user. This deletes the credentials saved to disk and resets the global Fused API.

```python showLineNumbers
import fused
fused.api.logout()
```

## Get Bearer (Access) token

Get the account's Bearer (sometimes referred to as Access) token.

```python showLineNumbers
import fused
fused.api.access_token()
```

This can be helpful when calling UDFs [via HTTP requests](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#private-token) outside of the Fused Python SDK and Workbench to authenticate with the Fused API.

:::warning Do not share your Bearer token

Do not share your Bearer token with anyone. These allow to impersonate your account and should be treated as such.
