This guide shows how to execute a batch job with [fused-py](/python-sdk/) from a Jupyter Notebook. It was inspired by a [Discord community request](https://discord.com/channels/1199097729243152434/1267578417411526788/1267578417411526788).


Running long processes can be computationally expensive, or liable to interruptions from network disconnections. For these cases, [`fused-py`](/python-sdk/) can run batch jobs on an EC2 instance.

To illustrate, this guide shows how to trigger and monitor a batch job from a Jupyter Notebook to unzip a large file and upload it to S3.

This UDF downloads a zipped file from S3 file specified with `source_s3_path`, unzips it, then uploads it to the S3 path specified by `destination_s3_path`.

## 1. Define UDF

This UDF downloads a zipped file with `fused.download`, unzips it, and uploads the extracted files to the `destination_s3_path`. For simplicity, you may choose to write to your Fused S3 bucket path which you can find in your Workbench [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/) - otherwise, you might need to adjust permissions of the target bucket.

```python showLineNumbers
import fused

@fused.udf
def udf(
    source_s3_path = '',
    destination_s3_path = ''
):
    import zipfile
    import s3fs
    import os
    import pandas as pd

    file_path = fused.download(source_s3_path, source_s3_path.split('/')[-1])

    # Create a temporary directory to extract the files
    s3 = s3fs.S3FileSystem()
    with zipfile.ZipFile(file_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
        zip_ref.extractall('/tmp/unzipped_files')

    # Upload each file to the S3 bucket
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk('/tmp/unzipped_files'):
        for file in files:
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            print('file_path', file_path, destination_s3_path)
            s3.put(file_path, destination_s3_path)

    return pd.DataFrame({'status': ['success']}) # UDFs must return a table or raster

```

## 2. Run UDF [on an offline instance](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run_large/)

To go beyond the 120s limit of the default [`fused.run(udf)`](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#fusedrun) call we'll define a job and use [`job.run_remote()`](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run_large/#running-a-large-job-jobrun_remote) to make kick off a call on a large, offline instance.
Get in touch with Fused if your account doesn't have batch-mode enabled.

Note: Make sure to replace `<YOUR_DIR>` with your own directory.

```python showLineNumbers
job = udf(
    source_s3_path = 'https://datadownload-production.s3.amazonaws.com/WCMC_carbon_tonnes_per_ha.zip', 
    destination_s3_path = 's3://fused-users/fused/<YOUR_DIR>/dswid/WCMC_carbon_tonnes_per_ha_10gb/'
)
job_id = job.run_remote()
```

## 3. Monitor job

`job_id` has a [number of methods to monitor the job](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run_large/#accessing-job-logs). For example `job_tail_logs` streams logs as the job runs.

```python showLineNumbers
fused.api.job_tail_logs("df335890-4406-4832-bf93-6a3b092e496d")
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `Logs for: df335890-4406-4832-bf93-6a3b092e496d
Configuring packages and waiting for logs...`
}
</CellOutput>
