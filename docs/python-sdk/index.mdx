# Python SDK

The Fused Python SDK ([`fused-py`](https://pypi.org/project/fused/)) exposes utility functions to write, manage, and run Fused UDFs. Use it in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) or install it in your preferred Python environment.

## Documentation overview

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

## Install

:::note
    This step is only required if you're running `fused` on your end (locally or in a development environment). If you're working in [Workbench UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) or [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/) `fused` is already installed for you.
:::

1. Set up a Python environment:

We're using `venv` but you could use `conda` or any other environment manager in Python. 

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install the `fused` package:

Install the base package:
```bash
pip install fused
```

Or install with optional dependencies:
```bash
# For raster data processing
pip install "fused[raster]"

# For vector data processing
pip install "fused[vector]"

# Install all optional dependencies
pip install "fused[all]"
```

3. Authenticate:

The following will store a credentials file in `~/.fused/credentials`:

**In a notebook**
```py
from fused.api import NotebookCredentials
credentials = NotebookCredentials()
```

Run this snippet from a Notebook Cell and follow the authentication flow.

**In a Python script**

If you're not in a Jupyter Notebook, you can get the URL you need to authenticate by printing it:

```python showLineNumbers
from fused.api import NotebookCredentials

credentials = NotebookCredentials()
print(credentials.url)
```

Follow the URL in your browser to authenticate.
