# Python SDK

The Fused Python SDK ([`fused-py`](https://pypi.org/project/fused/)) exposes utility functions to write, manage, and run Fused UDFs. Use it in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) or install it in your preferred Python environment.

## Install

`fused-py` is a breeze to get started with.

1. Set up a Python environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Run:

```bash
pip install fused
```

3. Authenticate:

```py
from fused.api import NotebookCredentials
credentials = NotebookCredentials()
```

Run this snippet from a Notebook Cell and follow the authentication flow, which will store a credentials file in `~/.fused/credentials`.
