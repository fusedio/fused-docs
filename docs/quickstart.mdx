# Quickstart

Learn the basics of Fused!

### Log into Workbench

Start by logging into [Workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench), Fused's web IDE

### Write your first User Defined Function (UDF)

Fused is built around [User Defined Functions (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/), serverless Python functions that don't require any setup to run. Write your first UDF in Workbench: 

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
	import pandas as pd
	return pd.read_csv(path)
```

You have now loaded a DataFrame into Fused! 

### Instant feedback

We loaded housing data based on the [Kaggle Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset). 

To better compare house prices, we can calculate the price per area:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path: str = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv(path)
    housing['price_per_area'] = round(housing['price'] / housing['area'], 2)
    
    return housing[['price', 'price_per_area']]
```

You've made your first analysis!

### Make your data available as an API

Fused allows you to easily turn any code into an API, so you can reference it anywhere!

In Workbench:
1. Save your UDF
2. Click the "Share" icon
3. Create a new [shared token](/workbench/udf-builder/navigation/#share) by clicking "Share"
4. Copy the HTTPS endpoint

{/* <video width="100%" controls>
  <source src="/img/quickstart/Sharing_to_URL.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video> */}

import LazyReactPlayer from '@site/src/components/LazyReactPlayer';

<LazyReactPlayer
  className="video__player"
  playing={false}
  muted={true}
  controls
  height="100%"
  width="100%"
  url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/docs_rewrite/getting-started/Sharing_to_URL.mp4"
/>


You can now share your analysis with your team or use it in any application!
