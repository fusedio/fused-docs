```

### Edit code to make an analysis

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path: str = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv(path)
    housing['price_per_area'] = housing['price'] / housing['area']

    return housing['price_per_area'].mean().round(2)
```
