# Get started with Fused! ðŸš€

There are 2 ways to use Fused:
1. [Workbench](/workbench/overview/), our web-based IDE
2. [Python library](/python-sdk/)

## Installation

Install `fused-py` with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) and **Python 3.10+**:

```python
pip install "fused[all]"
```

Follow the dedicated [installation guide](/python-sdk/#python-install) for more details.

## Basic UDF

Fused is built around the concept of User Defined Functions (UDFs).

A UDF is a Python function decorated with `@fused.udf` that can be run anywhere - in the cloud, on your local machine, or embedded in web applications. Read more about [why UDFs](/core-concepts/why/).

{/* TODO: simplify this to only do it once.  */}
```python
import fused
```

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(x: int) -> str:
    return f"Hello, World! {x}"
```

- **In Workbench**: No need to import `fused` and you can execute UDFs directly.
- **In a Python script**: You need to import `fused` and run the UDF with `fused.run(udf)`.

NOTE: For the rest of the this guide we'll assume you either have `fused-py` installed or are in [Workbench](/workbench/overview/) so won't ask you to do `import fused` in your code.


## Data input

Fused UDFs run Python code, so you can use Python libraries to read and write data from a variety of sources.

{/* TODO: Local file might not be the best example because we'd need to show how to upload it to Fused first */}
{/* TODO: Use actual files */}


```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv("local_file.csv")                       # Reading from a local file
    df = pd.read_parquet("s3://bucket/path/to/file.parquet") # Reading from S3
    df = pd.read_parquet("gs://bucket/path/to/file.parquet") # Reading from GCS

    return df
```

### Output formats

A UDF can return a variety of data formats:

{/* TODO: Fix this example, the numpy doesn't work */}
```python
@fused.udf
def udf(x: int = 1):
    return x * 2                        # Returning python types

    return {"value": x * 2}             # Returning dict

    import numpy as np
    return np.array([x * 2])            # Returning np.array

    return np.array([x * 2]), [x * 3]   # Returning multiple objects
```

Check out the list of [fully supported data formats](/core-concepts/write/#return-object). 

### Writing data

You can also decide to write data inside a UDF:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(x: int = 1):
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame({"a": [x * 2]})

    df.to_parquet("/mnt/cache/local_file.parquet")     # Writing to Fused mount

    df.to_parquet("s3://bucket/path/to/file.parquet")  # Writing to S3

    return "Processed & Saved!"
```

Note: The [/mnt/cache](/core-concepts/content-management/file-system/#mntcache-disk) disk is used to store data cross multiple runs of UDFs. This is the fastest way to write data between UDFs.

{/* TODO: Add section title something that says this is run from anywhere with Python SDK */}
### Calling UDFs from anywhere outside of Workbench

Fused UDFs can be called from a lot of places:

```python
fused.run(udf, x=1)            # Calling from a Python object

udf.to_fused()
token = udf.create_access_token()
fused.run(token, x=1)          # Calling from a token (especially from another python script)
```

{/* TODO: Would be nice to have a handy way to get HTTP request directly from fused-py. */}

Read more about all [the different ways to call UDFs](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/).

### Running UDFs in parallel

UDfs can be run 1 time or in parallel:

```python
fused.run(udf, x=1)            # Running a single UDF

fused.submit(udf, range(10))   # Running 10 UDFs at once
```
