# Get started with Fused! ðŸš€

There are 2 ways to use Fused:
1. [Workbench](/workbench/overview/), our web-based IDE
2. [Python SDK](/python-sdk/)

## Installation

Install `fused-py` with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) and **Python 3.10+**:

```python
pip install "fused[all]"
```

Follow the dedicated [installation guide](/python-sdk/installation/) for more details.

## Basic UDF

Fused is built around the concept of User Defined Functions (UDFs).

A UDF is a Python function decorated with `@fused.udf` that can be run anywhere - in the cloud, on your local machine, or embedded in web applications. Read more about [why UDFs](/core-concepts/why/).

```python
import fused

@fused.udf
def udf(x: int) -> str:
    return f"Hello, World! {x}"
```

- **In Workbench**: No need to import `fused` and you can execute UDFs directly.
- **In a Python script**: You need to import `fused` and run the UDF with `fused.run(udf)`.

NOTE: For the rest of the this guide we'll assume you either have `fused-py` installed or are in [Workbench](/workbench/overview/) so won't ask you to do `import fused` in your code.


## Data input

Fused UDFs run Python code, so you can use Python libraries to read and write data from a variety of sources.

{/* TODO: Local file might not be the best example because we'd need to show how to upload it to Fused first */}

```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv("local_file.csv")                       # Reading from a local file
    df = pd.read_parquet("s3://bucket/path/to/file.parquet") # Reading from S3
    df = pd.read_parquet("gs://bucket/path/to/file.parquet") # Reading from GCS
    
    import geopandas as gpd
    gdf = gpd.read_file("local_file.geojson")                # Reading from a local file
    gdf = gpd.read_file("s3://bucket/path/to/file.geojson")  # Reading from S3
    gdf = gpd.read_file("gs://bucket/path/to/file.geojson")  # Reading from GCS
    gdf = gdf.read_file("'https://../example.geojson'")      # Reading from a URL
```

### Output formats

A UDF can return a variety of data formats:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(x: int = 1):
    return x * 2                        # Returning int

    return {"value": x * 2}             # Returning dict

    import pandas as pd
    return pd.DataFrame({"a": [x * 2]}) # Returning pd.DataFrame

    import numpy as np
    return np.array([x * 2])            # Returning np.array

    import numpy as np
    return np.array([x * 2]), [x * 3]   # Returning multiple objects
```

Check out the list of [fully supported data formats](/core-concepts/write/#return-object). 

### Writing data

You can also decide to write data inside a UDF.

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(x: int = 1):
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame({"a": [x * 2]})

    df.to_csv("/mnt/cache/local_file.csv")             # Writing to Fused mount

    df.to_parquet("s3://bucket/path/to/file.parquet")  # Writing to S3

    return "Processed & Saved!"
```

Note: The [/mnt/cache](/core-concepts/content-management/file-system/#mntcache-disk) disk is used to store data cross multiple runs of UDFs. This is the fastest way to write data between UDFs.

### Calling UDFs from anywhere

Fused UDFs can be called from a lot of places:

```python
fused.run(udf, x=1)            # Calling from a Python object

token = udf.get_access_token()
fused.run(token, x=1)          # Calling from a token
```

Congratulations, you've touched on all the core features of Fused. ðŸŽ‰

Now you can dive deeper into more advanced topics:
- Learn more about [UDFs](/core-concepts/why/) (We showed how to return static vector files, but we can do a lot more!)
- Take a deeper look at [Workbench](/workbench/overview/)
- Play around with the [Use Cases](/use-cases/) to see Fused in action
- Look into the [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog/) to find UDFs from the community you could leverage
- Dive into the `fused` [Python SDK](/python-sdk/)
- Learn about how [Fused handles caching](/core-concepts/cache/)
