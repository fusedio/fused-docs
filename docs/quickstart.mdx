# Get started with Fused! ðŸš€

The simplest way to use Fused is to run it in [Workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench), our web-based IDE.

### Your first UDF

{/* TODO: Showcase the most basic UDF */}

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(msg: str = "Hello, World!"):
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.DataFrame({"msg": [msg]})
```

Fused is built around [User Defined Functions (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/):
- Runs serverless Python code. No env & infra setup required.

### Loading data

You can use libraries you know to load data:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv("s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing_2020.csv")
    return housing
```

TODO: Wb to load table view

### Visualize your data

TODO: Make a bar chart of price


### Instant feedback

Visualizing just housing price isn't helpful when comparing houses. Let's visualize the price per area instead:

```python {5}
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv("s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing_2020.csv")
    housing['price_per_area'] = housing['price'] / housing['area']
    return housing
```

TODO: Update chart to now show price per area

### Calling UDFs from anywhere

On top of making visualizations you can also call UDFs from anywhere:

**From Python**:

```python
import fused

fused.run("housing")
```

**From HTTPS**:

```bash
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_2H08xCuml9QRnACo4NeZ1S/run/file?
```

**From DuckDB**:

```sql
select * from read_json('https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_2H08xCuml9QRnACo4NeZ1S/run/file?');
```


### Scaling analysis

We made a simple analysis for 1 year. But we want to see the big picture. What's the mean price per area over the last few years?

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(year: int = 2020):
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv(f"s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing_{str(year)}.csv")
    housing['price_per_area'] = housing['price'] / housing['area']

    mean_price_per_area = housing['price_per_area'].mean()
    print(f"{mean_price_per_area=}")
    return mean_price_per_area.round(2)
```

We can now run this in parallel:

```python
fused.submit(udf, range(2020, 2025))
```

### Dashboard

TODO: Dashboard of mean price per area over the last few years, directly taken from output


{/* TODO: Show that we can scale analysis over many different files or inputs */}

### Sharing your analysis

Any dashboard can be shared out with anyone
