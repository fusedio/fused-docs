# Quickstart

Learn the basics of Fused!

### Log into Workbench

Start by logging into [Workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench), Fused's web IDE

### Write your first User Defined Function (UDF)

Fused is built around [User Defined Functions (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/), serverless Python functions that don't require any setup to run. Write your first UDF in Workbench: 

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
	import pandas as pd
	return pd.read_csv(path)
```

You have now loaded a DataFrame into Fused! 

We loaded housing data based on the [Kaggle Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset). 

To better compare house prices, we can calculate the price per area:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path: str = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv(path)
    housing['price_per_area'] = round(housing['price'] / housing['area'], 2)
    
    return housing[['price', 'price_per_area']]
```

You've made your first analysis!

### Vibe Coding a dashboard

You can ask the AI Assistant to build an interactive dashboard for you! Once you're happy with the data you have in your analysis simply type:

```text
Build an interactive dashboard for me showing the price per area of the houses
```

The AI will add some HTML code to render your analysis in an interactive dashboard. Save your UDF and the deployed version of your UDF will update with an interactive dashboard!

import LazyReactPlayer from '@site/src/components/LazyReactPlayer'

<LazyReactPlayer
  className="video__player"
  playing={false}
  muted={true}
  controls
  height="100%"
  width="100%"
  url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/docs_rewrite/tutorials/creating_quickstart_dashboard_lower_res.mp4"
/>

### Deploy your dashboard

In Workbench:
1. Save your UDF (`Cmd + S` on MacOS)
2. Click the "Share" icon.
3. Copy the HTTPS endpoint!

You can now share your analysis with your team or use it in any application! Any changes you make to your UDF will be reflected in your dashboard after you refresh!
