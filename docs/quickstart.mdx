# Get started with Fused! ðŸš€

In this Quickstart we'll show you how to make this dashboard in just a few minutes: from raw datasets to a shareable interactive dashboard:

**TODO: Update this with housing dashboard**

### Your first UDF

The simplest way to use Fused is to run it in [Workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench), our web-based IDE.

{/* TODO: Showcase the most basic UDF */}

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(msg: str = "Hello, World!"):
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.DataFrame({"msg": [msg]})
```

Fused is built around [User Defined Functions (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/):
- Runs serverless Python code. No env & infra setup required.
- Requires the [`@fused.udf`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedudf) decorator

### Loading data

You can use libraries you know to load data:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path: str = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv(path)
    return housing
```

Select "Table" in Workbench to visualize the output of your UDF as a table.

<summary>Workbench Preview </summary>

You should see something like this:

</details>

### Make your first chart

**TODO: Histogram of all prices of houses in a single year**


### Instant feedback

Visualizing the total housing price isn't all that helpful when comparing houses. Let's calculate the price per area instead:

```python {5}
@fused.udf
def udf(path: str = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv(path)
    housing['price_per_area'] = housing['price'] / housing['area']
    return housing
```

We can now update our chart to show price per area:

**TODO: -> Update chart to now show price per area**

### Calling UDFs from anywhere

On top of making visualizations you can also call UDFs from anywhere:

**TODO: IF we show this: Need to show how to get token from UDF**

**From Python**:

```python
import fused

fused.run("housing") # Assuming this is the name of your UDF
```

**From HTTPS**:

```bash
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_2H08xCuml9QRnACo4NeZ1S/run/file?
```

**From DuckDB**:

```sql
select * from read_json('https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_2H08xCuml9QRnACo4NeZ1S/run/file?');
```


### Scaling analysis

We made a simple analysis for 1 year. But we want to see the big picture. What's the mean price per area over the last few years?

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path: str = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv(path)
    housing['price_per_area'] = housing['price'] / housing['area']

    return housing['price_per_area'].mean().round(2)
```

We can get the list of all years we have data for:

```python
housing_years = fused.api.list_files("s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/")
```

We can now run this in parallel with 55 workers:

```python
fused.submit(udf, housing_years, max_workers=len(housing_years))
```

```bash
| path | result |
|------|--------|
| s3://fused-sample/.../housing_1970.csv | 1376.80 |
| s3://fused-sample/.../housing_1971.csv | 1492.04 |
...
| s3://fused-sample/.../housing_2023.csv | 2298.41 |
| s3://fused-sample/.../housing_2024.csv | 2367.89 |
```

### Interactive Canvas

**TODO: Insert working dashboard**
- Add a Title
- Add Histogram of average price per area since 1970


{/* TODO: Show that we can scale analysis over many different files or inputs */}

### Sharing your analysis

Simply hit "Share" in the top right corner of the Canvas and you can share your interactive dashboard to anyone!
- Any updates to your UDFs & Frames will be reflected in the Canvas
- Anyone can move Frames around & edit the dashboard, without any code
