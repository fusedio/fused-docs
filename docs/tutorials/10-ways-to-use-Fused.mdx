# 10 Ways to Use Fused

Here are 10 ideas for how to use Fused!

### Convert data quickly

Need to quickly convert a slow file into a modern format and save it to the cloud?

```python
import fused 

@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_excel("https://example.com/sales_data_2023.xlsx")
    df.to_parquet("s3://my-bucket/sales_data.parquet")
    
    return df

fused.run(udf)
```

### Run your code 100s of time in 3 lines of code

What if you have many spreadsheets you want to convert into a different format? Scale to [hundreds of jobs](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#running-multiple-jobs-in-parallel) with [`fused.submit`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedsubmit)

```python
excel_files = [
    "https://example.com/sales_data_2023.xlsx",
    "https://example.com/sales_data_2024.xlsx",
    "https://example.com/sales_data_2025.xlsx",
    ...
]

results = fused.submit(
    udf,
    excel_files,
)
```

### Partition large files

Use [`fused.ingest()` to partition](/core-concepts/data-ingestion/ingestion-your-data/) giant files that are too big to work with into smaller chuncks

```python
# Ingesting Washington DC Census data
job = fused.ingest(
    input="https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/LAYER/TRACT/tl_rd22_11_tract.zip",
    output=f"fd://census/partitioned/",
)

job.run_remote()
```

### Work with huge datasets from your laptop

Get samples of large datasets by writing code locally and running it on Fused, get data back to your laptop:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd
    large_dataset = pd.read_parquet("s3://my-bucket/my-large-dataset.parquet")

    return large_dataset.sample(10)
```

Then call this UDF from your laptop and start working with a subset of data:

```python
sample_data = fused.run(udf)
```

### Join datasets together

{/* TODO: Find example */}

### Explore new datasets in seconds

Interact with your data through Table & Map view. Iterate, get feedback from your code directly

### Turn an analysis into an API instantly!

You've just worked on a new analysis:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path: str='s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2000.csv'):
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv(path)

    df['price_per_area'] = round(df['price'] / df['area'], 2)

    return df[['price', 'area', 'bedrooms', 'price_per_area']]
```

And want to share it someone on your team. Directly send them a link to the dataset. 

From Workbench, get snippets to directly get your data into your team's favorite tools:

**HTTPS**

```
https://staging.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_1vKlsYuDPER8D3zK5mzRJI/run/file?
```

**DuckDB**

```
select * from read_parquet('https://staging.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_1vKlsYuDPER8D3zK5mzRJI/run/file?');
```

**Import in Google Sheets!**

```
=importData("https://staging.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_1vKlsYuDPER8D3zK5mzRJI/run/file?dtype_out_vector=parquet")
```

{/* TODO: Link to more examples */}

### Python & DuckDB on the fly

DuckDB is quickly becoming a go-to tool for data analysis. For example, load a whole month of climate weather data:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(
    month: str = "2024-01-01",
):
    import duckdb
    result = duckdb.sql(f"""
      SELECT 
          datestr::VARCHAR as datestr,
          ROUND(AVG(daily_mean), 2) as daily_mean_temp
      FROM 's3://fused-asset/data/era5/t2m/datestr={month}*/*.parquet'
      GROUP BY datestr
      ORDER BY datestr
    """).df()
    
    return result
```
### Get performance metrics of Python code

Get memory, file size & runtime usage of your code directly in [Workbench](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/):
