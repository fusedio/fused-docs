### Prompts

We're giving the [AI Assistant](/workbench/ai-assistant/) context of a few datasets so you can directly ask questions about them:

```text
Open the first few rows of Airbnb houses in NYC
```

```text
Calculate the Price per person & group by neighborhood 
```

```text
Compare these prices for each neighbourhood across San Francisco and New York 
```

```text
I'm interested in buying properties to rent out. Make an analysis of the data to see which neighborhood should I buy in? Return data in a table so I can preview it first
```

```text
Show me a beautiful dashboard of the most interesting properties from an investment point of view. Show a simple scatterplot of the distribution and some key metrics above it.
```
