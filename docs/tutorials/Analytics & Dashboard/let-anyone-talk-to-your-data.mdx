# Let anyone talk to your data

Let anyone talk to your data directly, in plain English.

### Try it out: [udf.ai](https://udf.ai/)

At [`udf.ai`](https://udf.ai/), you can:
- Directly ask questions to data sources we've connected
- Connect your own data sources through MCP Servers

{/* TODO: add video once this is live with latest udf.ai */}

### Turn a UDF into an MCP Server in 1min

Any UDF can be turned [into an API](/tutorials/engineering-etl/#turn-your-data-into-an-api) easily:

1. Create a new UDF that returns the data you want people to explore, for example:

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_parquet('s3://fused-sample/demo_data/ERA5/climate_data/2024-08.pq')
    return df
```

2. [Save your UDF](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/#save-a-udf) with `Cmd + S` (MacOS) / `Ctrl + S` (Win / Linux)

3. Create a new AI Profile in the [AI Assistant](/workbench/ai-assistant/)

    - In the [AI Assistant](/workbench/ai-assistant/) click the "..." icon then go to "Settings"
    - Go to the "Profiles" dropdown and click "+ Add Profile"
    - Name this "MCP Creater"
    - In the Code Prompt field paste:

    ```text
    You are an AI assistant that converts Fused UDF code into MCP JSON format. Given a UDF code snippet and its shared token, return a JSON object with the following structure:

    1. **Name**: Generate a descriptive 2-3 word name based on the UDF's functionality (use snake_case)
    2. **Link**: Construct the URL using this format: `https://unstable.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/{SHARED_TOKEN}/run/file?dtype_out_raster=png&dtype_out_vector=json`
    - Don't forget to replace `{SHARED_TOKEN}` with your actual shared token. If you have both a Shared token (system‑generated) and a private User‑created share token, always use the private one.
    3. **Description**: Write a clear explanation including:
    - What the UDF does
    - All parameters it accepts (with defaults if any)
    - What it returns/outputs
    - When someone might use this UDF
    - Any important notes about behavior or error handling
    4. **Parameters**: Extract parameter names and their types from the function signature

    Format your response as valid JSON with this structure:
    
    `json
    {
        "udf_name": {
            "link": "constructed_url_here",
            "description": "detailed_description_here",
            "parameters": {
                "param_name": "param_type"
            }
        }
    }
    `
    ```

4. Close the "Settings" tab
5. Switch to the "MCP Creater" profile in the AI Assistant
6. Ask it to convert the UDF into an MCP Server: 

```text
Turn this UDF into an MCP Server
```

The AI should give you a JSON object back with your MCP Server details. For example:

```json
{ 
    "climate_parquet": { 
        "link": "https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/UDF_Pandas_Parquet/run/file?dtype_out_raster=png&dtype_out_vector=json", 
        "description": "This MCP loads a Parquet (or GeoParquet) file containing daily mean temperature data for August 2024 from an S3 bucket and returns it as a pandas DataFrame.\n\n- Parameters: None – the file path is hard‑coded inside the function.\n- Return value: A pandas DataFrame with two columns: datestr (date string) and daily_mean_temp (temperature value).\n- Typical use cases: Quickly load a static climate dataset for exploratory analysis, charting, or further processing within the Fused Workbench.\n- Notes: The function performs no transformation; it simply reads the file. If the Parquet file contained geometry columns, they would be preserved for vector visualizations.", 
        "parameters": {} 
    } 
}
```

7. Add this JSON directly into the [UDF.ai](https://udf.ai/) MCP Configuration JSON
