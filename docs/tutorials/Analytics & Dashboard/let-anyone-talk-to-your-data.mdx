# Let anyone talk to your data

Make your data available through MCP servers in 1min and let anyone talk to your data directly, in plain English without any setup!

### Try it out: [udf.ai](https://udf.ai/)

At [`udf.ai`](https://udf.ai/), you can:
- Directly ask questions to data sources we've connected
- Connect your own data sources through MCP Servers

This allows you to make your data or analysis available for _anyone_ to directly talk to. No additional setup required

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

<ReactPlayer 
  className="video__player"
  playing={false}
  muted={true}
  controls
  height="100%"
  width="100%"
  url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/docs_rewrite/tutorials/Updated_ui_demo_udf_ai_compressed.mp4"
/>


### Turn your data into an MCP Server

You can pass any URL that returns a JSON object to [`udf.ai`](https://udf.ai/). The simplest way is still to turn your data into an MCP Server through a [Fused UDF](/core-concepts/write/)

Any UDF can be turned [into an API](/tutorials/engineering-etl/#turn-your-data-into-an-api) easily:

**Experimental: Using MCP Creator Profile in [AI Assistant](/workbench/ai-assistant/)**

1. Go to the [Preferences](/workbench/preferences/)
2. Turn on "AI MCP Profile" 

![AI Profile Flag in Preferences](/img/tutorials/ai_profile_flag.png)

This will give you a new profile called "MCP Creator" in the AI Assistant:

![MCP Creator Profile in AI Assistant](/img/tutorials/MCP_creator_profile.png)

3. Switch to this new "MCP Creator" profile in the AI Assistant

4. Ask it to convert the UDF into an MCP Server: 

```text
Turn this UDF into an MCP Server
```

The AI should give you a JSON object back with your MCP Server details. For example:

```json
{ 
    "climate_parquet": { 
        "link": "https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/<your_udf_shared_token>/run/file?dtype_out_raster=png&dtype_out_vector=json", 
        "description": "This UDF does some super dupper cool processing. Call it when the user wants to do something super dupper cool. No parameters are needed.", 
        "parameters": {} 
    } 
}
```

5. Add this JSON directly into the [udf.ai](https://udf.ai/) MCP Configuration JSON
6. Reload the chat

Ask any questions you want to your data to [`udf.ai`](https://udf.ai/)!

```
What was the highest temperature in August 2024?
```

### Sharing

We currently store the MCP Configuration JSON in your browser's local storage. This means you can't directly share the link to someone else (for now), but you can simply copy your JSON and send it to them.

Since UDF endpoints are accessible by anyone with the link by default, anyone can directly talk to your data with the right JSON!
