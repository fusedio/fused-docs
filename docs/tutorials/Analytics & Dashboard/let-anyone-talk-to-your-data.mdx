# Let anyone talk to your data

Let anyone talk to your data directly, in plain English.

{/* topics
- udf.ai -> Letting anyone talk to any data source
- how to setup an MCP server in Fused in 1min
- Parse it to udf.ai
 */}

The process is simple:
- UDFs can be deployed in a couple of clicks.
- We can easily turn these into MCP Servers that LLMs can talk to
- We built [`udf.ai`](https://udf.ai/) to showcase this in action: A frontend that calls any of your MCP Servers and creates dashboard for it

Any UDF can be turned [into an API](/tutorials/2min-with-fused/#turn-any-data-into-an-api) easily.
