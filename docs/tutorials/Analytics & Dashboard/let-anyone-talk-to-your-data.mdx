# Let anyone talk to your data

Make your data available through MCP servers in 1min and let anyone talk to your data directly, in plain English without any setup!

### Try it out: [udf.ai](https://udf.ai/)

At [`udf.ai`](https://udf.ai/), you can:
- Directly ask questions to data sources we've connected
- Connect your own data sources through MCP Servers

This allows you to make your data or analysis available for _anyone_ to directly talk to. No additional setup required

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

<ReactPlayer 
  className="video__player"
  playing={false}
  muted={true}
  controls
  height="100%"
  width="100%"

### Turn your data into an MCP Server

You can pass any URL that returns a JSON object to [`udf.ai`](https://udf.ai/). The simplest way is still to turn your data into an MCP Server through a [Fused UDF](/core-concepts/write/)

Any UDF can be turned [into an API](/tutorials/engineering-etl/#turn-your-data-into-an-api) easily:

**Experimental: Using MCP Creator Profile in [AI Assistant](/workbench/ai-assistant/)**

1. Go to the [Preferences](/workbench/preferences/)
{/* TODO: Check this is correct naming once it's in */}
2. Turn on "MCP Creator AI Profile" 

![AI Profile Flag in Preferences](/img/tutorials/ai_profile_flag.png)


This will give you a new profile called "MCP Creator" in the AI Assistant:

![MCP Creator Profile in AI Assistant](/img/tutorials/MCP_creator_profile.png)

3. Switch to this new "MCP Creator" profile in the AI Assistant

4. Ask it to convert the UDF into an MCP Server: 

```text
Turn this UDF into an MCP Server
```

The AI should give you a JSON object back with your MCP Server details. For example:

```json
{ 
    "climate_parquet": { 
        "link": "https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/UDF_Pandas_Parquet/run/file?dtype_out_raster=png&dtype_out_vector=json", 
        "description": "This MCP loads a Parquet (or GeoParquet) file containing daily mean temperature data for August 2024 from an S3 bucket and returns it as a pandas DataFrame.\n\n- Parameters: None – the file path is hard‑coded inside the function.\n- Return value: A pandas DataFrame with two columns: datestr (date string) and daily_mean_temp (temperature value).\n- Typical use cases: Quickly load a static climate dataset for exploratory analysis, charting, or further processing within the Fused Workbench.\n- Notes: The function performs no transformation; it simply reads the file. If the Parquet file contained geometry columns, they would be preserved for vector visualizations.", 
        "parameters": {} 
    } 
}
```

5. Add this JSON directly into the [UDF.ai](https://udf.ai/) MCP Configuration JSON
6. Reload the chat

Ask any questions you want to your data to [`udf.ai`](https://udf.ai/)!

```
What was the highest temperature in August 2024?
```
