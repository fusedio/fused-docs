# Let anyone talk to your data

Make your data available through MCP servers in 1 minute. Let anyone talk to your data directly in plain English; no setup required!

### Try it out: [udf.ai](https://udf.ai/)

At [`udf.ai`](https://udf.ai/), you can:
- Directly ask questions to data sources we've connected
- Connect your own data sources through MCP Servers

This makes your data or analysis available for _anyone_ to talk to directly; no additional setup required.

### Turn your data into an MCP Server

Pass any URL that returns JSON to [`udf.ai`](https://udf.ai/). The simplest approach: turn your data into an MCP Server using a [Fused UDF](/core-concepts/write/).

Any UDF can be turned [into an API](/tutorials/engineering-etl/#turn-your-data-into-an-api) easily:

**Experimental: Using MCP Creator Profile in [AI Assistant](/workbench/ai-assistant/)**

1. Go to the [Preferences](/workbench/preferences/)
2. Turn on "AI MCP Profile" 

![AI Profile Flag in Preferences](/img/tutorials/ai_profile_flag.png)

This will give you a new profile called "MCP Creator" in the AI Assistant:

![MCP Creator Profile in AI Assistant](/img/tutorials/MCP_creator_profile.png)

3. Switch to this new "MCP Creator" profile in the AI Assistant

4. Ask it to convert the current UDF you have open into an MCP Server: 

```text
Turn this UDF into an MCP Server
```

The AI should give you a JSON object back with your MCP Server details. For example:

```json
{ 
    "climate_parquet": { 
        "link": "https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/<your_udf_shared_token>/run/file?format=png,json", 
        "description": "This UDF does some super duper cool processing. Call it when the user wants to do something super duper cool. No parameters are needed.", 
        "parameters": {} 
    } 
}
```

5. Add this JSON directly into the [udf.ai](https://udf.ai/) MCP Configuration JSON
6. Reload the chat

Ask any questions you want to your data to [`udf.ai`](https://udf.ai/)!

### Sharing

MCP Configuration JSON is stored in your browser's local storage. You can't share links directly yet, but you can copy your JSON and send it to others.

Since UDF endpoints are accessible by anyone with the link by default, anyone can directly talk to your data with the right JSON!
