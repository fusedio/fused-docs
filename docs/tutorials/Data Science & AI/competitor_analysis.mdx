title: "Competitor Store Location Analysis"
---

This tutorial will:
- Explore the location of 2 store chains in Sacramento, CA
{/* TODO: Better word for catchment */}
- Create catchments of drive time around each store
- Join catchments with census data (population, average income)
- Determine which of our stores are most effective at reaching the target population, with the least competition. 

## Getting Data

{/* Topics
- Finding data online -> Using the search tool? 
- Using data already in Fused?
- Opening files from URLs with AI (from census)
 */}

## Exploring Data directly in Fused

{/* Topics
- Table / Map view
- Filtering to only where we want to look (filtering census by GEOID of Sacramento) 
 */}

## Creating catchments

{/* Topics
- Using Get_Isochrone UDF with @ context in AI to start + only returning a few geometries to test at first
- Visualizing on map
 */}

## Joining catchments & census data

{/* Topics
- Save outputs to file (for now. Passing UDFs context isn't working so well right now)
- Ask AI to join datasets directly. More details better. 
 */}

## Ranking stores

{/* Topics
- Create ranking based on population, income, competition
- Ask AI to make a chart to visualize results 
 */}

## Next Steps
{/* Topics
- Scaling to entire US. Need a different approach though
- Read more about AI in Fused
