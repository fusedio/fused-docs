title: "Competitor Store Location Analysis"
---

This tutorial will:
- Explore the location of 2 store chains in Sacramento, CA
{/* TODO: Better word for catchment */}
- Create catchments of drive time around each store
- Join catchments with census data (population, average income)
- Determine which of our stores are most effective at reaching the target population, with the least competition. 

:::info Using AI prompts as a starting point

This tutorial will show you what prompts we're using to build this analysis. 

Note that since AI is not deterministic, the prompts may not always work the same way. You might need to do some manual changes to the prompts or to the code to get it working. 

Consider the prompts as a starting point, but not the final answer.

## Getting Data

{/* Topics
- Finding data online -> Using the search tool? 
- Using data already in Fused?
- Opening files from URLs with AI (from census)
 */}

We're going to use datasets we found online to this analysis. We'll consider:
- Starbucks point locations as our target stores. [Available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starbucks/store-locations)
- McDonald's point locations as our competitor stores. [Available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ben1989/mcdonalds-locations)
- Census Data to get population and average income of the area around each store.

### Starbucks & McDonalds locations

We can ask the AI to write a UDF to load these from the Kaggle `cURL` api:

![Downloading Starbucks data from Kaggle](../../../static/img/tutorials/data-science-ai/starbucks_kaggle_download.png)

```text
Open this specific dataset and return points as a dataframe based on this Kaggle curl request:

#!/bin/bash
curl -L -o ~/Downloads/store-locations.zip\
  https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/starbucks/store-locations
```

In order to simplify this tutorial we've already downloaded the data and saved it to a bucket in Fused:

- Starbucks: `s3://fused-sample/demo_data/catchment_analysis/starbucks_location.pq`
- McDonalds: `s3://fused-sample/demo_data/catchment_analysis/macdonalds_location.pq`

### Census Data

You can get all the relevant Census Data on the official [US Census website](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html). 

For simplicity however we've also already downloaded the data and made it available. We'll be looking at [Census Block Groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_block_group) (BG) data for this analysis

- Sacramento, CA Census Block Groups: `s3://fused-users/fused/max/demos/california_population/acs_bg_ca_2022_sacramento_geoparquet.parquet`

## Exploring Data directly in Fused

We recommend you make 1 UDF for each dataset so you can explore them individually as layers on the [Map View](/workbench/udf-builder/map/). 

### Starbucks

Make a new UDF and ask the AI:

```text
can you open this starbucks location file (s3://fused-users/fused/max/demos/catchment_analysis/starbucks_sacramento.pq) and return as geodataframe 
```

### McDonalds

Make another new UDF and ask the AI:

```text
can you open this macdonalds location file (s3://fused-users/fused/max/demos/catchment_analysis/mcdonalds_sacramento.pq) and return as geodataframe 
```

### Census Data

Make another new UDF and ask the AI:

```text
Can you open this file using geopandas as return df s3://fused-users/fused/max/demos/california_population/acs_bg_ca_2022_sacramento_geoparquet.parquet
```

Renaming each UDF to their respective names and changing the color of each store in the [Visualization Tab](/workbench/udf-builder/viz-styling/) to something more visible we get:

<details>
<summary>Visualization JSONs</summary>

You can copy paste these JSONs into the [Visualization Tab](/workbench/udf-builder/viz-styling/) to have similar colored stores:

    ]
  }
}

## Creating isochrones

The Fused [AI Assistant](/workbench/ai-assistant/) can take other UDFs in context to use as inpsiration to adapt existing code to a new use case.

We're going to open the [Get Isochrone UDF](https://www.fused.io/workbench/udf/catalog/Get_Isochrone-15dcecd8-c401-42a8-b9f0-a9dac3d7ddc3) and use this one as inspiration for the AI. This UDF:
- Uses the [Valhalla API](https://valhalla.github.io/valhalla/api/isochrone/api-reference/) to create isochrone of drive time around a point
- Returns a GeoDataFrame with the isochrone polygons

This is exactly what we want to do for our Starbucks points! The parameters we want for this analysis are:
- 15min 
- drive time (`auto` [costing mode](https://valhalla.github.io/valhalla/api/turn-by-turn/api-reference/#costing-models))

However this API can take a lot of time to run, so we're going to break our problem down:
1. Ask the AI to use the `Get_Isochrone` UDF but only for 3 points to start
2. Validate that isochrones look correct
3. Manually increase the number of calls to the API we'll do.

### Step 1: Ask the AI to use the `Get_Isochrone` UDF but only for 3 points to start

To start:
- Open the [`Get_Isochrone` UDF](https://www.fused.io/workbench/udf/catalog/Get_Isochrone-15dcecd8-c401-42a8-b9f0-a9dac3d7ddc3) in Workbench. You don't need to make a copy but you need to have it opened.
- Go into the chat for your `starbucks_location` UDF. 
- Make sure to write `@Get_Isochrone` in the AI request so the AI adds that UDF to its context.

Ask the AI (in the chat for your `starbucks_location` UDF):
```text
Use @Get_Isochrone to create 15-minute driving isochrones around each starbucks location. 

Test this out with just 3 points first so we make sure this is working correctly at first
```

You can then visually see on the map we get 3 isochrones:

import LazyReactPlayer from '@site/src/components/LazyReactPlayer'

<LazyReactPlayer
  url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/docs_rewrite/tutorials/catchments_from_get_isochrone_compressed.mp4"
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  controls={true}
  playing={false}
/>


We'll leave it up to you to manually increase the number of calls if you'd like to. But for simplicity we also provide the output directly as a file:

`s3://fused-users/fused/max/demos/catchment_analysis/starbucks_isochrones_15min.pq`

## Joining catchments & census data

{/* Topics
- Save outputs to file (for now. Passing UDFs context isn't working so well right now)
- Ask AI to join datasets directly. More details better. 
 */}

## Ranking stores

{/* Topics
- Create ranking based on population, income, competition
- Ask AI to make a chart to visualize results 
 */}

## Next Steps
{/* Topics
- Scaling to entire US. Need a different approach though
- Read more about AI in Fused
