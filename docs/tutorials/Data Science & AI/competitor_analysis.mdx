title: "Competitor Store Location Analysis"
---

This tutorial will:
- Explore the location of 2 store chains in Sacramento, CA
{/* TODO: Better word for catchment */}
- Create catchments of drive time around each store
- Join catchments with census data (population, average income)
- Determine which of our stores are most effective at reaching the target population, with the least competition. 

:::info Using AI prompts as a starting point

This tutorial will show you what prompts we're using to build this analysis. 

Note that since AI is not deterministic, the prompts may not always work the same way. You might need to do some manual changes to the prompts or to the code to get it working. 

Consider the prompts as a starting point, but not the final answer.

## Getting Data

{/* Topics
- Finding data online -> Using the search tool? 
- Using data already in Fused?
- Opening files from URLs with AI (from census)
 */}

We're going to use datasets we found online to this analysis. We'll consider:
- Starbucks point locations as our target stores. [Available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starbucks/store-locations)
- McDonald's point locations as our competitor stores. [Available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ben1989/mcdonalds-locations)
- Census Data to get population and average income of the area around each store.

### Starbucks & McDonalds locations

We can ask the AI to write a UDF to load these from the Kaggle `cURL` api:

![Downloading Starbucks data from Kaggle](../../../static/img/tutorials/data-science-ai/starbucks_kaggle_download.png)

```text
Open this specific dataset and return points as a dataframe based on this Kaggle curl request:

#!/bin/bash
curl -L -o ~/Downloads/store-locations.zip\
  https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/starbucks/store-locations
```

In order to simplify this tutorial we've already downloaded the data and saved it to a bucket in Fused:

- Starbucks: `s3://fused-sample/demo_data/catchment_analysis/starbucks_location.pq`
- McDonalds: `s3://fused-sample/demo_data/catchment_analysis/macdonalds_location.pq`

### Census Data

You can get all the relevant Census Data on the official [US Census website](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html). 

For simplicity however we've also already downloaded the data and made it available. We'll be looking at [Census Block Groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_block_group) (BG) data for this analysis

## Exploring Data directly in Fused

We recommend you make 1 UDF for each dataset so you can explore them individually as layers on the [Map View](/workbench/udf-builder/map/). 

### Starbucks

Make a new UDF and ask the AI:

```text
can you open this starbucks location file (s3://fused-users/fused/max/demos/catchment_analysis/starbucks_sacramento.pq) and return as geodataframe 
```

### McDonalds

Make another new UDF and ask the AI:

```text
can you open this macdonalds location file (s3://fused-users/fused/max/demos/catchment_analysis/mcdonalds_sacramento.pq) and return as geodataframe 
```

### Census Data

Make another new UDF and ask the AI:

```text
Can you open this file using geopandas as return df s3://fused-users/fused/max/demos/california_population/acs_bg_ca_2022_sacramento_geoparquet.parquet
```

Renaming each UDF to their respective names and changing the color of each store in the [Visualization Tab](/workbench/udf-builder/viz-styling/) to something more visible we get:

<details>
<summary>Visualization JSONs</summary>

You can copy paste these JSONs into the [Visualization Tab](/workbench/udf-builder/viz-styling/) to have similar colored stores:

## Creating catchments

{/* Topics
- Using Get_Isochrone UDF with @ context in AI to start + only returning a few geometries to test at first
- Visualizing on map
 */}

## Joining catchments & census data

{/* Topics
- Save outputs to file (for now. Passing UDFs context isn't working so well right now)
- Ask AI to join datasets directly. More details better. 
 */}

## Ranking stores

{/* Topics
- Create ranking based on population, income, competition
- Ask AI to make a chart to visualize results 
 */}

## Next Steps
{/* Topics
- Scaling to entire US. Need a different approach though
- Read more about AI in Fused
 */}
