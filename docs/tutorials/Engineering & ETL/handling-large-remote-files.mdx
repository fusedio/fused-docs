# Handling Large Remote Files

You might want to work with datasets that:
- Aren't available through an API
- Are too large to be simply dragged & drop into Fused

This page shows you how to work with such files in Fused

## Download Large Files to Fused

{/* TODO:
- Code: UDF to download files
- Use Batch jobs to download large files
- When to do to this / when not do */}

## Work with compressed formats

### ZIP

### RAR

### Other formats
