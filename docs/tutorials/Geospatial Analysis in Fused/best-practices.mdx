# Best Practices

### Explore data in "Map View"

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';


While you might be tempted to explore a specific row of a `GeoDataFrame` by filtering it and printing it, sometimes it faster to just click on it in [Map View](/workbench/udf-builder/map/). Once selected, use the tooltip copy icon to copy the object as JSON, which you can then inspect elsewhere.

### Changing map view

Map View supports [multiple base maps](/workbench/udf-builder/map/#map-controls) that might be better suited for different uses cases.

- ‚ßâ Sometimes you just want a neutral basemap to focus on your data -> "Light" or "Dark" or even "Blank" basemaps are best
- üåç Other times you might want some context, in which case using the "Satellite" basemap will suit your need best

### Using the Visualize Tab 

You can easily change the styling of your data in the [Visualization Tab](/workbench/udf-builder/styling/):
- [Changing the color of your data](/workbench/udf-builder/styling/#color-styling) (especially for vector files)
- Using Visualize presets under "Preset"
- [Creating your own custom `loadingLayer`](/workbench/udf-builder/styling/#custom-loadinglayer-and-errorlayer)

### Adjusting Opacity for Better Insights (Advanced Tips)

Opacity control is essential for analyzing layered or dense data:

- **Detecting data density**: Lower opacity (20-50%) helps identify areas where multiple points or features overlap, appearing as darker regions
- **Visualizing through layers**: Set opacity between 30-70% to see underlying basemaps or other data layers
- **Highlighting confidence levels**: Use opacity to represent confidence or importance of different features

##### Example: Vegetation Segmentation with Semi-Transparent Overlay

The [Vegetation Segmentation UDF](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/b87a6638603d96f0eb13a1d259474817227b9245/public/Vegetation_Segmentation) demonstrates how reducing opacity helps visualize segmentation results while still seeing the underlying imagery:

```json
"rasterLayer": {
  "@@type": "BitmapLayer",
  "opacity": 0.3,
  "pickable": true
}
```

This visualization uses:
- 30% opacity to show the vegetation segmentation results as a semi-transparent overlay
- The underlying satellite imagery remains visible for context
- The pickable property allows users to hover over areas to see detailed values

#### Detecting Feature Overlaps

Finding overlapping features is crucial for data validation and analysis:

- **Fill vs. stroke emphasis**: For overlap detection, use filled polygons with 40-60% opacity and thin strokes
- **Contrasting colors**: Use complementary colors when you need to distinguish overlapping features
- **Using H3 hexagons**: Convert irregular polygons to H3 hexagons for a regularized comparison
- **Color-coding categories**: Assign different colors to intersection vs. difference areas

##### Example: Advanced Overlap Analysis with H3 Hexagons

The [Overture East Asian Buildings IOU UDF](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/b87a6638603d96f0eb13a1d259474817227b9245/public/Overture_East_Asian_Buildings_IOU) compares 2 datasets together. Here's the visualisation we used:

```json
{
  "tileLayer": {
    "@@type": "TileLayer",
    "minZoom": 0,
    "maxZoom": 14,
    "tileSize": 256,
    "extrude": true,
    "pickable": true
  },
  "hexLayer": {
    "opacity": 0.5,
    "@@type": "H3HexagonLayer",
    "stroked": true,
    "filled": true,
    "pickable": true,
    "extruded": true,
    "getFillColor": {
      "@@function": "colorCategories",
      "attr": "how",
      "domain": [
        "intersection",
        "symmetric_difference"
      ],
      "colors": "TealRose"
    },
    "getHexagon": "@@=properties.hex",
    "getElevation": "@@=properties.ratio",
    "elevationScale": 50
  }
}
```

This visualization uses:
- H3 hexagons to normalize irregular polygon shapes
- Different colors to show where datasets overlap vs. differ
- Elevation to represent the overlap ratio
- 50% opacity to see through overlapping features

### Tilt Map view to explore 3D datasets

Map View gives you a top-level view of the world by default. But hold `Cmd` (or `Ctrl` on Windows / Mac) to tilt the view!

![Tilted View](/img/user-guide/best-practices/3dmap.png)

üèòÔ∏è This can be really helpful to explore 3D datasets like in this [DSM Zonal Stats UDF](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/DSM_Zonal_Stats-0c801e56-d0c4-47e8-a5ce-90d37703bdb7).

{/* NOTE: No mention of actual keyboard shortcut because at time of writing it's `Shift + Home` but home isn't a proper shortcut and conflicts */}
:::tip
You can reset the view by running the "Reset 3D view to top-down" shortcut from [Command Palette](/core-concepts/best-practices/workbench-best-practices/#using-keyboard-shortcuts-command-palette)
