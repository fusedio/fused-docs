# Working with Spatial Data: Single vs Tile

There are 2 main ways to work with spatial data in Fused:

## Single UDF

Single UDFs are the default behavior in Fused. The UDF is run 1 time with the current viewport bounds.

There are 2 types of Spatial Single UDFs:

### Single (Viewport)

Will prioritize the current MAP VIEWPORT bounds, regardless of the `bounds` parameter.

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bounds: fused.types.Bounds = [-74.38,40.32,-73.31,41.29]):
    print(bounds) # This will be the current MAP VIEWPORT bounds, regardless of the `bounds` parameter
    return bounds
```

### Single (Parameter)

Will use the `bounds` parameter, regardless of the current MAP VIEWPORT bounds.

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bounds: fused.types.Bounds = [-74.38,40.32,-73.31,41.29]):
    print(bounds) # This will be the `bounds` parameter, regardless of the current MAP VIEWPORT bounds
    return bounds
```

### Example UDF

- [Get Isochrone](https://www.fused.io/workbench/udf/catalog/Get_Isochrone-15dcecd8-c401-42a8-b9f0-a9dac3d7ddc3)
    - Returns a isochrone (how far a person cal walk / drive) polygon for a given point

## Tile UDF

Tile UDFs tile the users viewport into a grid of smaller tiles and running a UDF for each.

### Example UDF

- [Overture Maps Example](https://www.fused.io/workbench/udf/catalog/Overture_Maps_Example-64071fb8-2c96-4015-adb9-596c3bac6787)
    - Shows _all_ the buildings from the Overture Maps dataset
- [Landsat Tile Example](https://www.fused.io/workbench/udf/catalog/Landsat_Tile_Example-942a9608-77cb-4d2b-8627-ea5f2747d96d)
    - Returns NDVI tile computed on the fly from Landsat data

## Comparing Single and Tile UDFs

{/* TODO: review this section & link out */}

| Feature | Single UDF | Tile UDF |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| UDF Calls | 1 | Multiple |
| Parameters | `bounds` (Optional) | `bounds` or `x`, `y`, `z` |
| Map rendering | Static | Dynamic |
| HTTP Call | Single Call | Tile Server calls |
| Use when | Small static data | Calling large dataset through tile server |

## `bounds`

`bounds` is simply a list of 4 coordinates representing the bounds of a geometry. The 4 coordinates represent `[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]` of the bounds.

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bounds: fused.types.Bounds=None):
    print(bounds)

>>> [-1.52244399, 48.62747869, -1.50004107, 48.64359255]
```

### `bounds` to `GeoDataFrame`

Converting `bounds` (list of 4 coordinates) to a `GeoDataFrame`:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
  <TabItem value="fused" label="Fused common function" default>
    ```python showLineNumbers
    @fused.udf
    def udf(bounds: fused.types.Bounds=None):
        common = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/fbf5682/public/common/")
        return common.bounds_to_gdf(bounds)
    ```
</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Python Libraries" label="shapely & geopandas">
        ```python showLineNumbers
        @fused.udf
        def udf(bounds: fused.types.Bounds=None):
            import shapely
            import geopandas as gpd
            box = shapely.box(*bounds)
            return gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=[box], crs=4326)
        ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## OLD: Displaying Spatial Data: Tile vs Single (Viewport, Parameter)

When spatial UDFs are called (i.e. that return spatial data like a `GeoDataFrame` or an array of `GeoTiff` tiles), they [run](/core-concepts/run-udfs/) and return the output of the execution like any UDF. However they can be called in two ways that influence how Fused handles them: `Tile` and `Single`.

This is an important distinction and can be changed in Workbench at the top of the UDF editor:

<ReactPlayer playsinline={true} className="video__player" playing={false} muted={true} controls height="100%" url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/docs_rewrite/File_Tile_Viewport3.mp4" width="100%" />

We'll demonstrate the differences with a simple UDF that takes a [`bounds` object](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/filetile/#the-bounds-object) as input and display how it behaves differently in each mode:

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bounds: fused.types.Bounds):
    import geopandas as gpd
    from shapely.geometry import box
    
    # Returning bounds to gdf
    gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=[box(*bounds)], crs=4326)
    return gdf
```

### Single (Viewport)

Selecting `Single (Viewport)` mode, the UDF runs within a single call.

If you run the example UDF, make sure to select `Single (Viewport)` mode in the UDF editor, execute it with "Shift + Enter" and zoom out you'll see that `gdf` covers the viewport you had:

![File (Viewport)](/img/core-concepts/file_tile/File_bounds_udf.png)

**We generally recommend using `Single (Viewport)` mode when :**
- Working with smaller datasets that fit into memory
- Wanting to load data that doesnâ€™t move each time you pan around
- Wanting 1 seamless layer without tiling artifacts
- Wanting data at a specific resolution

### Tile

By contrast, `Tile` mode runs your UDF multiple times over a grid of [Mercator Tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map) that cover the viewport. We aim to use anywhere from 2 to 15 tiles to cover the current viewport. 

Looking at the same UDF and selecting `Tile` mode, we get many different tiles:

<ReactPlayer playsinline={true} className="video__player" playing={false} muted={true} controls height="100%" url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/docs_rewrite/Tile_bounds_udf2.mp4" width="100%" />

You can see a few other differences:
- This UDF is called each time you move around the Map Viewport
- We need to "Freeze" the viewport for it to stop rendering. This is in contrast to `Single (Viewport)` mode where the UDF is called once and panning in Map View doesn't re-run the UDF

**We generally recommend using `Tile` mode when :**
- Loading a lot of data at once (since the UDF is called multiple times over a smaller extent each time)
- Wanting a more dynamic, responsive panning & scrolling experience
- Wanting a dynamic resolution to be calculated for your image rendering based on your current zoom level

:::tip

The mode you select for a UDF is saved with the UDF. You can decide which mode you prefer people to use for your UDF by selecting the mode in the UDF editor.

### Legacy types

These types are still currently supported in `fused` though only for legacy reasons and will soon be deprecated.

#### [Legacy] `fused.types.Tile`

This is a [geopandas.GeoDataFrame](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.html) with `x`, `y`, `z`, and `geometry` columns.

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bounds: fused.types.Tile=None):
    print(bounds)

>>>      x    y   z                                           geometry
>>> 0  327  790  11  POLYGON ((-122.0 37.0, -122.0 37.1, -122.1 37.1, -122.1 37.0, -122.0 37.0))
```

#### [Legacy] `fused.types.TileGDF`

This behaves the same as [`fused.types.Tile`](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/filetile/#legacy-fusedtypestile).

#### [Legacy] `fused.types.ViewportGDF`

This is a [geopandas.geodataframe.GeoDataFrame](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.html) with a `geometry` column corresponding to the Polygon geometry of the current viewport in the Map.
```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bbox: fused.types.ViewportGDF=None):
    print(bbox)
    return bbox

>>>  geometry
>>>  POLYGON ((-122.0 37.0, -122.0 37.1, -122.1 37.1, -122.1 37.0, -122.0 37.0))
```

#### [Legacy] `bbox` object

UDFs defined using the legacy keyword `bbox` are automatically now mapped to `bounds`. Please update your code to use `bounds` directly as this alias will be removed in a future release.

## Call HTTPS endpoints

A UDF called via an [HTTPS endpoint](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#https-requests) is invoked as `Single` or `Tile`, depending on the URL structure.

### Single endpoint

This endpoint structure runs a UDF as a `Single`. See implementation examples with [Felt](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/other-integrations/#felt) and Google Sheets for vector.

```bash
https://www.fused.io/server/.../run/file?dtype_out_vector=csv
```

:::info
   In some cases, `dtype_out_vector=json` may return an error. This can happen when a GeoDataFrame without a `geometry` column is being return or a Pandas DataFrame. You can bypass this by using `dtype_out_vector=geojson`.
:::

### Tile endpoint

This endpoint structure runs a UDF as a `Tile`. The `{z}/{x}/{y}` templated path parameters correspond to the Tile's XYZ index, which Tiled web map clients dynamically populate. See implementation examples for Raster Tiles with [Felt](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/other-integrations/#felt) and [DeckGL](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/other-integrations/#deckgl), and for Vector Tiles with [DeckGL](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/other-integrations/#deckgl) and [Mapbox](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/other-integrations/#mapbox).

```bash
https://www.fused.io/server/.../run/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?&dtype_out_vector=csv
```

## Tile UDF behavior in `fused.run()`

UDFs behave different when using `fused.types.Tile` than in any other case. When passing a `gpd.GeoDataFrame`. `shapely.Geometry` to bounds:

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run(tile_udf, bounds=bounds)
```

Or passing `X Y Z`:

```python showLineNumbers
fused.run(tile_udf, x=1, y=2, z=3)
```

The `tile_udf` gets tiled and run on [Web mercator XYZ tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map) and then combined back together to speed up processing rather than executing a single run. This is in contrast to most other UDFs (either using no `bounds` input at all or using `bounds: fused.types.Bounds`) which run a single run across the given input.
