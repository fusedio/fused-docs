# Zonal Statistics

Zonal statistics across raster & vector data can be quite computationally expensive. H3 on the other hand allows to perform all operations as tabular data. 

This page shows the basics of performing zonal statistics on a H3 dataset

### On H3 datasets



### What about vector data?

In most cases the data we want to analyze is in vector format (building footprints, census blocks, zip codes, etc.). The steps are simply:

- Transform the vector data into a H3 dataset (more info [in this section](https://docs.fused.io/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/h3-tiling/ingesting-dataset-to-h3#vector-to-hex))
- Perform the zonal statistics on the H3 dataset

Once both datasets are in H3 hexagons, you can do all the same steps as in the [previous section](#on-h3-datasets)
