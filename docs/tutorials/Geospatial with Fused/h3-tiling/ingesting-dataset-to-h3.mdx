# Ingesting Dataset to H3

{/* TODO: Use this section: https://github.com/fusedlabs/fusedudfs/blob/main/Overture_Hexify/Overture_Hexify.py#L104 */}

## Vector to Hex

Example of ingesting a release of the Overture Building dataset to H3 hexagons:

:::note Run this in a notebook or a Python shell, not in Workbench

The following is similar to a [vector dataset ingestion](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/geospatial-data-ingestion/ingest-your-data), running on [batch jobs](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run_large/). 

Therefor we recommend running this in a notebook or a Python shell, not in Workbench.

:::

```python showLineNumbers
# Run this in a notebook or a Python shell, not in Workbench
username = fused.api.whoami()
release = '2025-01-22-0'
```

```python showLineNumbers
# Run this in a notebook or a Python shell, not in Workbench
args = [{'input_path': f's3://us-west-2.opendata.source.coop/fused/overture/{release}/theme=buildings/type=building/',
         'output_path': f's3://fused-users/fused/{username}/overture_overview/{release}/',
         'hex_res': 11}]
```

```python showLineNumbers
# Run this in a notebook or a Python shell, not in Workbench
Overture_Hexify = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedlabs/fusedudfs/tree/main/Overture_Hexify/")
j = Overture_Hexify(arg_list=args)

j.run_remote(instance_type='r5.16xlarge', disk_size_gb=999)
```
