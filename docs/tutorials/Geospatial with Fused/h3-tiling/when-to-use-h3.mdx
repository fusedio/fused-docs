# When to use H3

H3 is a hexagon tiling grid system based on Hexagons.

You can read more about H3 on [the H3 website](https://h3geo.org/).

H3 is particularly useful when:
- Creating heatmaps of events (populations, counts, etc.)
- Wanting to compare datasets across resolutions & scale
- Working with sparse datasets

Example of census population density heatmap for California:
