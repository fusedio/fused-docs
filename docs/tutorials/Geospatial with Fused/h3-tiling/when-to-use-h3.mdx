# When to use H3

H3 is a hexagon tiling grid system based on Hexagons.

You can read more about H3 on [the H3 website](https://h3geo.org/).

H3 is particularly useful when:
- Creating heatmaps of events (populations, counts, etc.)
- Wanting to compare datasets across resolutions & scale
- Working with sparse datasets

Example of census population density heatmap for California:

  width="100%"
  height="600px"
  frameBorder="0"
  style={{borderRadius: '8px'}}

### Hexagon UDFs

Examples of UDFs that use H3:

- [Ookla Download Speed Heatmap](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Ookla_Download_Speeds-12a8bc7e-5baf-4eac-b695-a4434cff0554): Visualize download speeds across the world.
- [US Crop Viewer](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Hex_CDL_explorer-5b621c26-590d-4a11-b30c-d8d24ca16b3e): Explore crops around the US
- [Overture Release Difference Heatmap](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Overture_Hex_Diff-b513710b-bc22-4eb3-9c3e-78672927abb8): Visually identify differences between 2 Overture Building dataset releases. 

### Converting Datasets to H3 tiles

We've provided a few options for converting datasets to H3 tiles:

| Type | Data Size | Hexagonification Type | H3 Output | Consideration |
|------|-----------|----------------------|-----------|---------------|
| [File to H3](./file-to-h3) | Small (< 100MB) | On the fly | Static Resolution | Easy to adjust. Can easily change field to hexagonify |
| [Dynamic Tile to H3](./dynamic-tile-to-h3) | Small (< 100MB) or Large (> 100MB) | On the fly | Dynamic Resolution | Easy to adjust. Can easily change field to hexagonify |
{/* | [Ingesting Dataset to H3](./ingesting-dataset-to-h3) | Large (> 100MB) | Pre-computed | Dynamic Resolution | Requires deciding on which variable to hexagonify ahead of time | */}
