# Crop Exploration with H3

This use case shows how to build an interactive dashboard joining together disparate datasets to explore the spatial patterns of crops in the United States. 

We'll bring together:

- Every Crop in the United States
- Elevation data for the entire country
- Temperature data

All on an interactive visualization:
