# Data Science & AI


### Discover data

- File Explorer
- Ask AI to make a reader for a basic file for you if you don't know how to
- Use Table view to explore data


### Work on your local machine

- Make subset of data in Wb, call UDF locally


### Join datasets together

- Call another UDF from within a UDF
- Ask AI to help with DuckDB / pandas queries 


### Serverless ML Inference

- After training: quick inference on new data
- Make data prediction as API directly


{/* TODOs:
- Creating a RAG
