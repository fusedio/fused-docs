# Data Science & AI


### Discover data

Explore data with Fused:

- Browse buckets without writing any code in [File Explorer](https://www.fused.io/workbench/files)
- Ask AI Assistant to write a simple reader for a file if you don't know how to:

```text
Use DuckDB to open this file and return first few rows: s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing_2024.parquet
```

- Return data as a `pandas.DataFrame` to see a preview of the data directly in Workbench

Examples:
- Explore the Fused demo data in [File Explorer](https://www.fused.io/workbench/files?path=s3%3A%2F%2Ffused-sample%2Fdemo_data%2F): `s3://fused-sample/demo_data/`


### Get a sample of data locally

Have a large dataset in the cloud, but want to explore some of it locally on your own machine? Write a simple UDF to return a subset and call it locally

(We assume you have [installed `fused`](/python-sdk/#python-install) & [authenticated](/python-sdk/authentication/#authenticate))

```python
import fused

@fused.udf
def udf(path: str='s3://fused-asset/data/era5/t2m/datestr=2024-01-01/0.parquet'):
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_parquet(path)

    return df.head(10)
```

```python
sample = fused.run(udf)
```

{/* TODO: Need to find a good example */}

{/* 

### Join datasets together

You can join datasets by calling another UDF from within a UDF:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd
    california_housing = pd.read_csv("s3://fused-sample/demo_data/california_housing.csv")
    return california_housing
```

- Ask AI to help with DuckDB / pandas queries

```text
Aggregate the data by year
``` */}

### Serverless ML Inference

- After training: quick inference on new data
- Make data prediction as API directly */}

{/* TODOs:
- Creating a RAG
 */}
