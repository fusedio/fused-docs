# Engineering & ETL


### Connect Data to Fused

#### Connect your own data sources

You can directly connect your data buckets to Fused:
- [AWS S3](/workbench/file-explorer/#amazon-s3)
- [Google Cloud Storage](/workbench/file-explorer/#google-cloud-storage-gcs)
- [GCP BigQuery](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/gee_bigquery/#bigquery)
- [Google Earth Engine](/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/gee_bigquery/#google-earth-engine)

#### Bring data directly inside Fused

Quickly bring any data not on the cloud into Fused:

1. Drag & Drop in [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/)!

![Drag and drop files directly into Workbench](/img/tutorials/drag_and_drop.gif)

2. Use [`fused.upload()`](/python-sdk/api-reference/api/#upload)

[Install `fused` Python](/python-sdk/#python-install) package & run:

```python
fused.api.upload("my_local_file.csv", "fd://my_data/file.csv")
```

Note: [`fd://`](/core-concepts/content-management/file-system/#fd-s3-bucket) is the [Fused provisioned private S3 path](/core-concepts/content-management/file-system/#fd-s3-bucket) for your team.


#### Optimize data loading

For files < 1GB:

Leverage [caching](/core-concepts/cache/#caching-basics) built in to Fused to make loading any data faster:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path: str = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd
    
    @fused.cache
    def load_data(path):
        return pd.read_csv(path)

    # Some processing 
    
    return load_data(path)
```

- Every time you rerun this UDF, the data will be loaded from cache. 
- This is especially useful for slow formats (CSV, Excel, etc.) or files that are not partitioned well.

For files > 1GB:

Use [`fused.ingest()`](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedingest) to load large datasets.

```python
job = fused.ingest(
    input="https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/LAYER/TRACT/tl_rd22_11_tract.zip",
    output=f"s3://fused-users/{user_id}/census/dc_tract/",
)

job.run_remote()
```

### Turn your data into an API

Share your data with the world by turning it into an API:

```python
def udf(path: str = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd

    df = pd.read_csv(path)
    
    # Only return the relevant data for my team
    df = df[df['price'] > 1000000]
    return df[['price', 'area']]
```

In [Workbench](/workbench/):
- Save your UDF
- Click "Share"
- Created a shared token
- You now have a HTTPs endpoint to call this UDF, which returns data in your desired format:

```bash
https://fused.io/.../run/file?
```

Learn more about [creating a shared token](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#shared-token).
