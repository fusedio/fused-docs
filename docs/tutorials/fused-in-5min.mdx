# Fused in 5 Minutes

Welcome to Fused! This tutorial will get you up and running in just 5 minutes with three simple examples that demonstrate the core concepts of User Defined Functions (UDFs).

## What is a UDF?

A User Defined Function (UDF) is a Python function decorated with `@fused.udf` that can be run anywhere - in the cloud, on your local machine, or embedded in web applications. Read more about [why UDFs](/core-concepts/why/).

## Example 1: Hello World UDF

Let's start with the simplest possible UDF:

```python
import fused

@fused.udf
def udf(x: int = 1):
    return f"Hello world {x + x}"

fused.run(udf)
```

**What this does:**
- Runs on Fused server on a [real machine](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/)
- The [`@fused.udf` decorator](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#fusedudf) makes this function runnable on Fused

**Try it:**
1. Copy this code into [Fused Workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench)
2. Click "Run" to execute it
3. You'll see the output: "Hello world 2"

## Example 2: Simple Data UDF

Now let's create a UDF that returns structured data:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(x: int = 5):
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.DataFrame({"x": range(x)})
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a pandas DataFrame with numbers from 0 to x-1
- Returns structured data that can be visualized or processed further
- Default value creates a DataFrame with 5 rows

**Try it:**
1. Paste this code into a new UDF in Workbench
2. Run it to see a table with values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
3. Try changing the parameter `x` to see different amounts of data

## Example 3: Simple Data File UDF

Finally, let's read real data from a file:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(x: int = 10):
    import pandas as pd
    # Read from a public dataset
    df = pd.read_parquet("s3://fused-asset/infra/building_msft_us.parquet")
    return df.head(x)
```

**What this does:**
- Reads a parquet file from cloud storage (S3)
- Returns the first `x` rows of the dataset
- This example uses Microsoft building footprint data

**Try it:**
1. Paste this code into Workbench
2. Run it to see building data
3. Try the File Explorer in Workbench to browse other available datasets

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've just created your first three UDFs. Here's what you can explore next:

- **File Explorer**: Browse available datasets in the Fused catalog
- **Map View**: Visualize geospatial data on an interactive map
- **Sharing**: Share your UDFs with others using shareable URLs
- **Advanced Features**: Explore caching, async operations, and more complex data transformations

## Key Concepts Learned

✅ **UDF Decorator**: `@fused.udf` transforms any Python function into a distributed, scalable function  
✅ **Type Hints**: Parameters should have type hints and default values  
✅ **Data Returns**: UDFs can return strings, DataFrames, or other data structures  
✅ **Cloud Integration**: Easily read from cloud storage like S3
