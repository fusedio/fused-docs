# Quick Wins with Fused

We'll show you quick ways to get started with Fused. All of these can be done in [Workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench).

### Open a simple dataset

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv(path)
```

### Convert data quickly

```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_excel("s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing_2024.xlsx")
    df.to_parquet("s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing_2024.parquet")
    
    return df
```

{/* TODO: Add join datasets example later */}

### Turn any data in API

Similar to our [Quickstart](/quickstart), we can turn any code into an API:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path: str = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv(path)
    housing['price_per_area'] = round(housing['price'] / housing['area'], 2)
    
    return housing[['price', 'price_per_area']]
```

### Preview datasets

### Profile your code

Workbench has a built-in profiler giving you:
- Line by line runtime
- Memory usage
- Total runtime
- Total file size

### Data First IDE: Table / Map view

Workbench is built for data teams. 

You can toggle between Map / Table view depending on your data!
