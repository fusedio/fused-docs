# Ingesting Datasets into H3

_How to ingest data into H3 cells_

### For small datasets

If you want to ingest a small dataset we have a dedicated page to do this with a public UDF: [Raster to Hexagon](/tutorials/others/transform/geospatial/raster-h3/)

### For large datasets

üöß **This section is still a Work in Progress** üöß 

{/* TODO:
High level explainer of how ingestion works to pass data into H3 cells
Simply show this, even if not showing code. 
Explain high level k-ring aggregation, explain how this works
 */}

For the rest of this guide we'll be using data already ingested into H3 cells, and available on [Source Cooperative](https://source.coop/repositories/fused/hex/description). 

Source Cooperative is a free repository of data, handled & managed by the Radiant Earth Foundation. [Fused simply provides](/blog/cdl-census-hex/) a partitioned & H3 tiled version of the USDA's Crop Data Layer & US Census data.
