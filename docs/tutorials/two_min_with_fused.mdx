# 2 min with Fused

Quick ways to get started with Fused in [Workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench).

### Open a simple dataset

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv(path)
```

### Convert data quickly

```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_excel("s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing_2024.xlsx")
    df.to_parquet("s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing_2024.parquet")
    
    return df
```

{/* TODO: Add join datasets example later */}
{/* ### Join datasets */}

### Turn any data into an API

Turn any code into an API (similar to our [Quickstart](/quickstart)):

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path: str = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv(path)
    housing['price_per_area'] = round(housing['price'] / housing['area'], 2)
    
    return housing[['price', 'price_per_area']]
```

### Preview datasets

Explore cloud storage directly in the [File Explorer](https://www.fused.io/workbench/files) tab

import LazyReactPlayer from '@site/src/components/LazyReactPlayer';

<LazyReactPlayer 
  className="video__player"
  playing={false}
  muted={true}
  controls

/>

### Profile your code

Workbench's built-in profiler provides:
- Line by line runtime
- Memory usage
- Total runtime
- Total file size

### Vibe coding in Fused

You can use Fused's AI to help you code! 

[Watch our setup video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFA5KQVIqxM) or:

- Create a new UDF
- In the "AI Assistant Tab": Type your prompt! (Or click the "microphone" icon to directly speak your prompt!)
- See your results! (or press Shift + Enter if it didn't auto run)

Share your build:
- Save UDF (Cmd + S)
- Click "Share"
- Click on the HTTPS link in the Share tab

Prompt & Repeat!

#### Prompt Ideas

If you already have some data:

```
Make an interactive HTML graph of this data
```

Make an up to date dashboard from scratch:

```
Build a very simple Wildfire tracking app in HTML using real world data
```

Fun ideas:

```
I'm bored, make a HTML game for me!
```

Examples:
- See how we're using [AI to build a climate dashboard](/use-cases/Climate%20Dashboard/#interactive-graph-with-ai)

#### Tips & Tricks

- Change the model! We provide models from all major vendors:
    - Kimi K2 -> Best well balanced model. Fast & Very Good
    - GPT 4.1 -> Advanced coding, higher context
    - Claude Opus 4 -> Slower, but great for complex coding
- Try out the suggestions! Our models auto suggest what you could do next based on all your code
- Ask crazy things you don‚Äôt know how to do!
- Come back tomorrow, we'll most certainly have some new stuff! üßë‚Äçüíª

#### Share your experience

- Tag [udf_ai on Twitter](https://x.com/udf_ai), we‚Äôll repost you!
- Share which prompts have worked with us!



### Data First IDE: Table / Map view

Workbench is built for data teams. 

Toggle between Map/Table view based on your data!

/>

### Return HTML code & make a chart!

You can return HTML code directly in Fused and turn your data into an embedded Chart:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
    from fastapi import Response
    import pandas as pd
    import altair as alt
    
    housing = pd.read_csv(path)
    housing['price_per_area'] = round(housing['price'] / housing['area'], 2)
    
    chart_html = alt.Chart(housing).mark_point().encode(
        x='price',
        y='price_per_area'
    ).to_html()

    
    return Response(chart_html.encode('utf-8'), media_type="text/html")
```

Go to the "Embed" tab to see your chart:
