# 2 min with Fused

Quick ways to get started with Fused in [Workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench).

### Open a simple dataset

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv(path)
```

### Convert data quickly

```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_excel("s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing_2024.xlsx")
    df.to_parquet("s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing_2024.parquet")
    
    return df
```

{/* TODO: Add join datasets example later */}
{/* ### Join datasets */}

### Turn any data into an API

Turn any code into an API (similar to our [Quickstart](/quickstart)):

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path: str = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
    import pandas as pd
    housing = pd.read_csv(path)
    housing['price_per_area'] = round(housing['price'] / housing['area'], 2)
    
    return housing[['price', 'price_per_area']]
```

### Preview datasets

Explore cloud storage directly in the [File Explorer](https://www.fused.io/workbench/files) tab

import LazyReactPlayer from '@site/src/components/LazyReactPlayer';

<LazyReactPlayer 
  className="video__player"
  playing={false}
  muted={true}
  controls
  height="100%"
  width="100%"
  url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/docs_rewrite/tutorials/File_explorer_from_file.mp4"
/>

### Profile your code

Workbench's built-in profiler provides:
- Line by line runtime
- Memory usage
- Total runtime
- Total file size

<LazyReactPlayer

/>

### Vibe coding in Fused

[Watch our setup video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFA5KQVIqxM) or simply ask AI to build something for you

Deploy your UDF:
- Save (`Cmd + S` on MacOS or click the "Save" button)
- Click "URL" button to see deployed dashboard!

#### Prompt Ideas

If you already have some data:

```
Make an interactive HTML graph of this data
```

Make an up to date dashboard from scratch:

```
Build a very simple Wildfire tracking app in HTML using real world data
```

Fun ideas:

```
I'm bored, make a HTML game for me!
```

### Data First IDE: Table / Map view

Workbench is built for data teams. 

Toggle between Map/Table view based on your data!

<LazyReactPlayer 
  className="video__player"
  playing={false}
  muted={true}
  controls
  height="100%"
  width="100%"
  url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/docs_rewrite/tutorials/Map_Table_alternating.mp4"
/>

### Return HTML code & make a chart!

You can return HTML code directly in Fused and turn your data into an embedded Chart:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(path = "s3://fused-sample/demo_data/housing/housing_2024.csv"):
    from fastapi import Response
    import pandas as pd
    import altair as alt
    
    housing = pd.read_csv(path)
    housing['price_per_area'] = round(housing['price'] / housing['area'], 2)
    
    chart_html = alt.Chart(housing).mark_point().encode(
        x='price',
        y='price_per_area'
    ).to_html()

    
    return Response(chart_html.encode('utf-8'), media_type="text/html")
```

Go to the "Embed" tab to see your chart:
