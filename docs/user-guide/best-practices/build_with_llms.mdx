# Building with LLMs: Getting things done, fast.

_Our mission at Fused is to help you get things done, fast. LLMs can help you write User Defined Functions, then leverage Fused to get feedback on your execution and make analytics faster_

This setup helps you setup [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) code editor in a way that helps you write & debug UDFs fast.

By the end of this guide you'll have:
- A custom Cursor setup that allows you to ask LLMs to write UDFs for you
- Cursor testing + debugging UDFs based on Fused best practices
- Gives you links to open UDFs in Workbench directly

## Requirements

- A Fused Account with an engine
- A Cursor account

## Setup

1. Make sure to have `fused` installed locally. 

This is to help Cursor write UDFs, save them to Workbench for you as well as test & debug them. 

```python
pip install "fused[all]" # this installs optional dependencies especially helpful for geospatial operations
```

2. (Optional but recommended) Clone the `udfs` public repo

At Fused we want to build things quickly so we make of a [common set of functions](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/blob/main/public/common/utils.py) we often re-use. 
You can pass this to Cursor to help it write UDFs without having to re-invent the wheel.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fusedio/udfs.git
cd udfs/
```

3. Start Cursor

```bash
cursor .
```

4. Give Cursor knowledge about Fused
- Go to Cursor settings -> "Indexing & Docs" -> "+ Add Docs"
- Give it `https://docs.fused.io/`

Under the hood Cursor will go index the Fused docs so it has access to all the examples, Python SDK & Best Practices.

5. Giving Cursor some Rules

We're constantly testing & tweaking the best practices for getting LLMs to help us write good UDFs. We can pass some of our findings to Cursor directly:
- Go to Cursor settings -> "Rules" -> "+ Add Rule"
- Copy the txt from this [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/MaxLenormand/6c72f27192c8a81d51bdf2e8d964ab5f) directly into the text field


## Getting unblocked

<details>
<summary>Cursor can't run fused properly</summary>

If you get errors when trying to run fused commands in Cursor, it's likely because Cursor is not using the right Python environment. Here are a few things to try:

1. Make sure you have the right Python environment activated. You can do this by:
   - Opening the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P)
   - Searching for "Python: Select Interpreter"
   - Selecting the environment where you installed fused

2. If that doesn't work pass what you need to activate the correct environment to Fused as rule:
- Go to Cursor settings -> "Rules" -> "+ Add Rule"
- Give it instructions, for example:

```md
Always run:
`source /Users/user/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh` and then `conda activate fused` to use the latest fused packages
```

3. Try restarting Cursor after activating the right environment

4. If all else fails, you can run fused commands in a separate terminal window while using Cursor for code editing
