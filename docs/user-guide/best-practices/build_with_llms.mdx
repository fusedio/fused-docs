# Building with LLMs: Getting things done, fast.

_Our mission at Fused is to help you get things done, fast. LLMs can help you write User Defined Functions, then leverage Fused to get feedback on your execution and make analytics faster_

This setup helps you setup [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) code editor in a way that helps you write & debug UDFs fast.

By the end of this guide you'll have:
- A custom Cursor setup that allows you to ask LLMs to write UDFs for you
- Cursor testing + debugging UDFs based on Fused best practices
- Gives you links to open UDFs in Workbench directly

## Requirements

- A Fused Account with an engine
- A Cursor account

## Setup

1. Give Cursor knowledge about Fused
- Go to Cursor settings -> "Indexing & Docs" -> "+ Add Docs"
- Give it `https://docs.fused.io/`

Under the hood Cursor will go index the Fused docs so it has access to all the examples, Python SDK & Best Practices.

2. Make sure to have `fused` installed locally. 

```python
pip install "fused[all]" # this installs optional dependencies especially helpful for geospatial operations
```
