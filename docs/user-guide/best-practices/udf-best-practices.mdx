_An opinionated guide to making the most out of Fused UDFs_

# Build & Running UDFs

[Fused UDFs](/core-concepts/write/) are Python functions that run on serverless compute and can be called from anywhere with `fused.run(my_udf)`. This guide is a resource meant to help you on your way to making the most out of UDFs.

## A short reminder: The anatomy of a UDF

A Fused UDF can be very simple:

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(my_awesome_input: int = 1):
    import pandas as pd

    return pd.DataFrame({"Look at my output: ": [my_awesome_input]})
```

Each UDF has a few specific elements:
- The [`@fused.udf` decorator](/core-concepts/write/#fusedudf-decorator)
- Arguments -ideally typed-
- imports _inside_ the function
- Some logic
- A [supported `return` object](/core-concepts/write/#return-object)

:::note
All of this is explained in the ["Write UDF"](/core-concepts/write/) section in much more details
:::

You can then run UDFs from _anywhere_ you have access to Python with `fused.run(udf)`. These are still Python functions, so there are some things to keep in mind to keep them fast & efficient

## Writing efficient UDFs

### Keep things small

UDFs run on Python serverless compute, but [quickly timeout](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#defining-small-job). The main benefit of Fused UDFs is how responsive they are. And the best way to do that is to keep things fast is to keep them small:

- Break pipelines into single tasks UDFs
- [Leverage `fused.run()`](/user-guide/best-practices/udf-best-practices/#leverage-fusedrun) to chain together UDFs

<details>
    <summary>Example: Breaking down a complex pipeline into smaller UDFs</summary>

    ❌ Not recommended:

    ```python showLineNumbers
    @fused.udf
    def inefficient_pipeline_udf(data_path):
        import pandas as pd

        df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
        # Some complicated processing logic to create df_processed
        processed_df = ... 

        return processed_df
    ```

    ✅ Instead, break it down:

    ```python showLineNumbers
    @fused.udf
    def load_data_udf(data_path):
        import pandas as pd
        return pd.read_csv(data_path)
    ```

    ```python showLineNumbers
    @fused.udf
    def process_data_udf(df):
        import pandas as pd

        # Some complicated processing logic to create df_processed
        processed_df = ... 

        return processed_df
    ```

    ```python showLineNumbers
    @fused.udf
    def pipeline_udf(data_path):
        import pandas as pd

        df = fused.run(load_data_udf, data_path=data_path)
        processed_df = fused.run(process_data_udf, df=df)

        return processed_df
    ```
</details>

### Run often, Iterate quickly

Just like writing short cells when developing in a Jupyter Notebook, we recommend you keep your UDFs short & fast to execute

You should aim for **UDFs that take 30s - 1min to run**

UDFs run with [`fused.run()`](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#fusedrun) [timeout after 120s](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#defining-small-job) so we recommend you keep a buffer in case your UDF takes a bit longer to execute

### [Cache](/core-concepts/cache/) as much as you can

Fused relies heavily on [caching](/core-concepts/cache/) repetitive tasks to make recurring calls much faster (and more compute efficient)

✅ You want to use caching for functions with inputs that are recurring:
- Loading a dataset
- Computing a recurring operation with default variables 
- Intermediate results 

❌ When not to use caching:
- In most cases, for functions taking `bbox` as an argument -> your function + input would get overwritten for each new `bbox` which probably changes for each new call

<details>
    <summary>Example: Caching a repetitive task</summary>

    Re-using the example from [keeping things small](/user-guide/best-practices/udf-best-practices/#keep-things-small):

    ❌ Not recommended:

    ```python showLineNumbers
    @fused.udf
    def inefficient_pipeline_udf(data_path):
        import pandas as pd

        df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
        # Some complicated processing logic to create df_processed
        processed_df = ... 

        return processed_df
    ```

    ✅ Instead, break it down AND cache the calls:

    ```python showLineNumbers
    @fused.udf
    def load_data_udf(data_path):
        import pandas as pd
        return pd.read_csv(data_path)
    ```

    ```python showLineNumbers
    @fused.udf
    def process_data_udf(df):
        import pandas as pd
        # Some complicated processing logic to create df_processed
        # ...
        return processed_df
    ```

    ```python {5-7,9-11} showLineNumbers
    @fused.udf
    def pipeline_udf(data_path):
        import pandas as pd

        @fused.cache
        def load_data(data_path):
            return fused.run(load_data_udf, data_path=data_path)

        @fused.cache
        def process_data(df):
            return fused.run(process_data_udf, df=df)

        df = load_data(data_path)
        processed_df = process_data(df)

        return processed_df
    ```
</details>

### Prepare your large datasets

Fused works at its best with data that's fast to read and can be read in tiles or chunks. We know that most of the data out there isn't in the most [efficient file formats](/core-concepts/data_ingestion/file-formats/) which is why we provide tools to [ingest your own data](/core-concepts/data_ingestion/ingestion-your-data/) into cloud-optimized, partitioned formats

We have a [dedicated page](/core-concepts/data_ingestion/why-ingestion/#when-is-ingestion-needed) for when you should consider ingesting your own data. As a rule of thumb you want to consider ingesting your data when:
- Files are read multiple times and >100Mb should
- Files that are slow or require some processing to open (`.zip` for example)

### Don't start from scratch: [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog/)

Just like using libraries in Python to leverage existing tools, you don't need to start from scratch in Fused. We have a [Catalog of existing UDFs](/workbench/udf-catalog/) built & maintained by us and the community

You can find a host of different UDFs that can serve as a starting point or as inspiration to create your own UDFs:
- Open datasets from common open repository [like STAC catalogs](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Sentinel_Tile_Example_2-ddb4c495-40e3-48ba-849c-256487f8a9cb)
- Run [on the fly ML prediction](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Dl4eo_Airplane_Detection_Global-91f81c0c-08f6-4a0c-82f9-bd2e0322b4e7) on satellite images
- Compute a [spatial join](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Overture_Nsi-dd89972c-ce30-4544-ba0f-81fc09f5bbef) between 2 datasets

You can also contribute your own UDFs to the community!

## Debugging UDFs 

### Use `print()`

### Use `time.time()`

## Leverage `fused.run()`

- Writing efficient UDFs
    - Cache as much as possible, but only when inputs & function don't change
    - Typing your inputs as much as possible
    - Aim for short jobs -> about 30s-1min so your jobs don't timeout
        - Use other UDFs if you're doing multiple operations
- Debugging UDFs
    - print statement with `print(f"{val=}")`
    - Use time.time() to find slow parts of your UDF if you're unsure about what's taking time
- Use workbench for exploration if you want a map view
- Using UDFs for all sorts of tasks
    - Leverage other UDFs to offload big tasks while staying in your local development
    - Leverage `fused.run()` locally to keep working in your favourite env
        - `fused.load()` + `fused.render()` in notebooks
- Don't hesitate to play around with `fused.run_remote()` for large jobs
