_An opinionated guide to making the most out of Fused UDFs_

# Build & Running UDFs

Fused UDFs are Python functions that you 

{/* 
Topics:
- Writing efficient UDFs
    - Cache as much as possible, but only when inputs & function don't change
    - Typing your inputs as much as possible
    - Aim for short jobs -> about 30s-1min so your jobs don't timeout
        - Use other UDFs if you're doing multiple operations
- Debugging UDFs
    - print statement with `print(f"{val=}")`
    - Use time.time() to find slow parts of your UDF if you're unsure about what's taking time
- Use workbench for exploration if you want a map view
- Using UDFs for all sorts of tasks
    - Leverage other UDFs to offload big tasks while staying in your local development
    - Leverage `fused.run()` locally to keep working in your favourite env
        - `fused.load()` + `fused.render()` in notebooks
- Don't hesitate to play around with `fused.run_remote()` for large jobs
