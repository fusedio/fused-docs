# Workbench best practices

_Tips & Tricks for making [Fused Workbench](/workbench/) work for you_

![Workbench Overview](/img/user-guide/best-practices/workbench_overview.png)

[Workbench](/workbench/) is a web-IDE built to make working with Fused UDFs even faster. It's packed with a lot of features!

## Experimenting with UDFs, fast

In [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/), Workbench's default page you have access to a [Code Editor](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/) that runs your UDFs and outputs results directly on the [Map View](/workbench/udf-builder/map/) for you. As soon as you make changes they show up in Map View! 

### Use `return` to quickly explore data

Your UDF will stop at the first `return` it sees, which you can use to your advantage to return an intermediate result and explore it directly on the map:

    <summary>Example: Exploring `bbox` mid-UDF</summary>

    In this example, we're using the [Overture Maps Example UDF](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Overture_Maps_Example-77970462-8c4d-44dd-87ad-3520f5d7bd83) but not sure exactly what our `bbox` object looks like.

    The easiest way to check is simply to return it inside our UDF before any other logic:

    {/* TODO: Add video once uploaded on S3  */}

</details>

{/* TODO: Need an example of doing this with a UDF */}

## Navigating Workbench

{/* 
Topics:
- Omnisearch
- File Explorer to UDF & UDF to File Explorer
 */}

## Troubleshooting

{/* 
Topics:
- Speeding up your workflow
    - Clicking on S3 links takes you directly to File Explorer
    - Also clicking on a File in S3 in File Explorer -> Fused does its best to guess which UDF to use to open it so you can easily go from file to exploring data in a UDF
    - Using Omnisearch for fast navigation
- UDF builder
    - return in the middle of UDF to quickly debug what might be going on with minimal edits
    - You don't always have to query in Python -> Map view allows you to inspect data directly
        - Leverage the different tabs under the "Results" section -> Explore data just by clicking on it
        - Sometimes changing basemap helps you see your results more visibly (either a light, dark basemap or aerial view)
    - Move code to "Module" to keep your UDF Editor focused on the most important code
    - Use Visualize Tab to help you debug things -> Under "Surprise Me" there are helpful presets & even debug option
        - When we're building things at Fused we often use:
            - `"filled": true,` -> Makes polygons easier to click on
            - `"lineWidthMinPixels": 10,` -> Making polygons or points wider & easier to spot
    - You can set a Default view even for UDFs that cover the whole world for example -> Helps if your working on a project with a global dataset but you want to easily focus on a specific area
    - we have a built-in line-length formatter! Hit `Option + Shift + F` (Alt + Shift + F on Windows / Linux)
- File Explorer
    - Bookmark commonly used S3 buckets 
    - Just use it to browse public S3 buckets, it's often faster than doing so in CLI!
- Troubleshooting
    - If things sometimes feel strange, your UDF output looks suspicious here are a few things you can do:
        - rerun the UDF with `Shift + Enter`
        - Check how much RAM your tab is using (in Chrome can easily do so by hovering the tab). Sometimes too much data is brought in to your browser and while we do our best to manage it properly it can get out of hand. A good old tab refresh goes a long way
