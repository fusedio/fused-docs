_A complete example show casing how to use Fused to ingest data into a geo-partitioned, cloud friendly format, process images & vectors and use UDFs to produce an analysis_

## 1. The problem: Detecting illegal boats

{/* Start by showing what the end result looks like: "this is what we're going to do in this example"*/}

Monitoring what happens at sea isn't the easiest task. Shores are outfitted with radars and each ship has a transponder to publicly broadcast their location (using [Automatic Identification System, AIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system)), but ships sometimes want to hide their location when taking part in illegal activities. 

Global Fishing Watch [has reported on "dark vessels"](https://globalfishingwatch.org/research-project-dark-vessels/) comparing Sentinel 1 radar images to public AIS data and matching the two to compare where boats report being versus where they _actually_ are. 

In this example, we're going to showcase a basic implementation of a similar analysis to identify _potential_ dark vessels, all in Fused.

Here's the result of our analysis, running in real time in Fused:

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

{/* <ReactPlayer playsinline={true} className="video__player" playing={true} muted={true} controls height="100%" url="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-walkthrough-videos/docs_rewrite/examples/dark-vessel-detection/output_analysis_S1_ais.mp4" width="100%" /> */}

{/* Need more context around how the analysis is done */}

Here are the steps we'll produce:
- Getting Sentinel 1 radar images over our Area of Interest and within our Time of Interest
- Run a simple algorithm to detect bright spots in radar images -> Return boats outline
- Fetch AID data over the same Area & Time of Interest
- Merge the 2 datasets together
- Keep boats that appear in Sentinel 1 but not in AIS -> Those are our potential Dark Vessels.

:::note
    This is crude analysis, mostly meant to demonstrate some of the major components of Fused, not to expose any dark vessels. The analysis has some major limitations and itself should be taken with a grain of salt. 
    
    That being said, we encourage you to use it as a starting point for your own work!
