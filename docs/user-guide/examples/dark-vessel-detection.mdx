_A complete example show casing how to use Fused to ingest data into a geo-partitioned, cloud friendly format, process images & vectors and use UDFs to produce an analysis_

## 1. The problem: Detecting illegal boats

{/* Start by showing what the end result looks like: "this is what we're going to do in this example"*/}

_ðŸš§ Under construction_

## 2. Data for our analysis

## 3. Ingesting AIS data

## 4. Retrieving Sentinel 1 images

## 5. Simple boat detection in Sentinel 1 radar images

## 6. Retrieving AIS data for our time of Interest

## 7. Merging the 2 datasets together
