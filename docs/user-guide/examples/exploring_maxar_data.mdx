_A guide showing how to use Fused to get all of Maxar's Open Data from all the available STAC catalogs and explore the imagery_

{/* TODO: Add image of Maxar's open data, or GIF of showing what this looks like */}

### Requirements
- [access to Fused](/user-guide/login/)

{/* Topics to write about
- Problem statement: Maxar offers a lot of imagery, but in individual STAC catalogs, not all in 1 place
- We'll show how to use fused.submit() to scale request in parallel to retrieve all their catalog in seconds
- Then find out data for any event we'd like to explore -> Use the latest available one at time of writing this example

### Display imagery
- Make another UDF just to display an image. At this point could look at it directly in 
- Could use "Parameters" in Workbench to make it easier to change visualize directly without having to change the code

### Duplicate UDF to then show another image
- Show how duplicates work in Workbench
- Can use Milind's code to show a leaflet side by side comparison even

Maxar, the high resolution satellite image company, offers some of their data in the open specifically for following natural disaster. This data is available as a series of [STAC Catalogs](https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/external/maxar-opendata.s3.amazonaws.com/events/catalog.json?.language=en) for each of event.

One of the limitation of this setup is that each event is its own STAC Catalog making it hard to parse through all the available Maxar open data if we were to look for specific images.

{/* TODO: Add image here of available STAC Catalogs */}

In this in-depth Example we'll:
- Show how to use `fused.submit()` to fetch all the available STAC Catalogs all at once in parallel in just a few seconds
- Filter for any data we want (latest event, only cloud free images, etc.)
- Write a UDF to then visualise some of the data
