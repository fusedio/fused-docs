_A step-by-step guide for data scientists._

## 1. Introduction to Fused

Fused [Workbench](/workbench/) is an end-to-end cloud platform for data analytics, built around User Defined Functions ([UDFs](/core-concepts/why/)) that can be invoked via HTTP requests.

- Run any Python code remotely within seconds
- Debug with instant feedback on a map
- Work with both vector and raster data
- Serve UDFs as HTTP endpoints
- Easily scale horizontally to hundreds of workers

You'll appreciate not having to set up any infrastructure because Fused takes your code and runs it in the cloud. The benefit is that there's zero configuration: you don't have to mess with clusters, Docker, or even an AWS account. Just bring your code.

In this guide, we'll introduce you to Fused by writing a simple zonal stats workflow. We'll explain Fused step by step: how to bring in your data, write a UDF to process the data, run the UDF remotely & in parallel, and create an app that invokes the UDF.

To get started, log in at [fused.io/workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench).

## 2. Bring in your data

In this guide, we'll estimate how much alfalfa grown in areas defined by buffers around polygon or point geometries. You'll first upload your own vector table with `fused.ingest`. This spatially partitions the table and writes it in your account's S3 bucket as a [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/). You'll then calculate zonal stats over a raster array of alfalfa crops in the [USDA Cropland Data Layer](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/cropscape-cropland-data-layer) (CDL) dataset.

This example shows how to geo partition polygons of [Census Block Groups](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html) for Utah, which is a parquet table with a `geometry` column. You can follow-along with this file or any vector table you'd like. Read about other supported formats in [Ingest your own data](/core-concepts/content-management/Ingest/).

Pass the URL of the table to `fused.ingest`. When you kick-off an ingest job with `run_remote`, Fused spins up a server to partition your table and writes the output to the path specified by the `output` parameter. In the codeblock below, `fd://` is the base path to your account's S3 bucket. Open [fused.io/jobs](https://www.fused.io/jobs) to view the job status and logs.

```python showLineNumber
import fused

job = fused.ingest(input="https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2023/BG/tl_2023_49_bg.zip", output="fd://tl_2023_49_bg/")
job_id = job.run_remote()
```

If you run this in a Python environment, make sure to install the latest Fused SDK with `pip install fused` and authenticate. You can also ingest data without installing anything in this [Fused app](https://www.fused.io/workbench#app/s/i/fa_6XEw7ACaNo7Qtxggt6Cm9e). Once the job is complete, you can preview the output dataset in the [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/).

For the next step you can use the path to the data you just ingested or, if you prefer, this public sample table `s3://fused-asset/data/tl_2023_49_bg/`.

## 3. Write a UDF to process the data

Now we will write a UDF that reads your data, prints a log to the console, and returns an output. To [write a UDF](/core-concepts/write/) simply wrap a Python function with `@fused.udf`. As you write code in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) you'll see how visualization results, logs, and errors show up immediately.

The first parameter of this UDF, `bbox`, is reserved for Fused to pass a `GeoDataFrame` which the UDF may use to spatially filter datasets - usually the geometry for a web map [tile](/core-concepts/filetile/). This enables Fused to run the UDF for each tile in the viewport to distribute processing across multiple workers.

The `year` parameter is used to structure the path of the CDL dataset which the utility function `read_tiff` loads for a given `bbox`. The `crop_id` parameter 36 corresponds alfalfa crop in the CDL [colormap](https://storage.googleapis.com/earthengine-stac/catalog/USDA/USDA_NASS_CDL.json), which the UDF uses to mask the raster array.

Fused lets you import utility Modules from other UDFs with `fused.utils`. Their code lives in the [public UDFs repo](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/blob/main/public/common/utils.py).

- `read_tiff` loads an array of the CDL dataset for the specified `year` and `bbox`
- `table_to_tile` loads the table you geo partitioned for a given `bbox`
- `geom_stats` calculates zonal statistics for the `gdf` and `arr` inputs

```python showLineNumber
@fused.udf
def udf(
    bbox: fused.types.TileGDF = None,
    year: int = 2020,
    crop_id: int = 36
):
    import numpy as np

    # Load CDLS data
    arr = fused.utils.common.read_tiff(
      bbox,
      input_tiff_path=f"s3://fused-asset/data/cdls/{year}_30m_cdls.tif"
    )

    # Mask for crop
    arr = np.where(np.isin(arr, [crop_id]), 1, 0)

    # Load polygons
    gdf = fused.utils.common.table_to_tile(
      bbox,
      table='s3://fused-asset/data/tl_2023_49_bg/',
      min_zoom=5,
      use_columns=['NAMELSAD', 'GEOID', 'MTFCC', 'FUNCSTAT', 'geometry']
    )
    gdf.crs = 4326

    # Calculate zonal stats
    return fused.utils.common.geom_stats(gdf, arr)
```

Try running the UDF in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) and visually inspect the output on the map. See what happens when you change `year` and add more `print` statements. Use print statements, such as `print(arr)` and `print(gdf)` to show logs in the console.

You can also [style the map layer](/workbench/udf-builder/styling/) by setting this JSON in the [Visualize tab](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/#visualize).

import Details from '@theme/MDXComponents/Details';

<Details open={false}>

```json showLineNumber
{
  "tileLayer": {
    "@@type": "TileLayer",
    "minZoom": 0,
    "maxZoom": 19,
    "tileSize": 256,
    "pickable": true
  },
  "rasterLayer": {
    "@@type": "BitmapLayer",
    "pickable": true
  },
  "vectorLayer": {
    "@@type": "GeoJsonLayer",

      "nullColor": [
        184,
        14,
        184
      ]
    },
    "getLineColor": [
      208,
      208,
      208,
      40
    ]
  }
}
```
</Details>

## 4. Run the UDF remotely and in parallel

Now that you have a UDF, let's see three ways you can [Run UDFs](/core-concepts/run/) remotely: via an HTTP endpoint, in a Python application, and in parallel.

### a. HTTP endpoint

Save the UDF and greate an HTTP endpoint for the UDF by clicking "Share" in the UDF Settings tab. You'll see snippets to call the UDF from anywhere using a [shared token](/core-concepts/run/#shared-token). Try this by changing the HTTP endpoint's query parameter as shown. You should see the output in GeoJSON format.

```javascript
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_46eSFZaR3q3SnoVB28pN0g/run/tiles/12/778/1548?dtype_out_vector=geojson&crop_id=36&year=2020
```

#### What just happened?

When you called the HTTP endpoint, Fused ran the UDF then sent back the output table and [debug logs](/core-concepts/write/#http-requests). In the URL above, `/12/778/1548` specifies the ZXY tile index to structure `bbox` and `dtype_out_vector=geojson` specifies the output format. Fused passes the `year` & `crop_type` parameters to the UDF as `int` based on their types in the function definition.

#### Why does this matter?

You called the HTTP endpoint with a shared token, which means any application may call the UDF and get data back without needing to authenticate. You also passed parameters to the UDF, which enables you to dynamically generate data and define its output format.

To start seeing the full power of Fused, change the UDF code and call the endpoint again. You'll see the UDF automatically updates. When you call the UDF again it should run even faster.

### b. Python SDK

The share token also enables you to run the UDF in a Python environment. You can specify `bbox` as the same map tile as above by passing `x`, `y`, and `z` parameters.

```python showLineNumber
import fused
fused.run("fsh_46eSFZaR3q3SnoVB28pN0g", x=778, y=1548, z=12)
```

You can also pass a `GeoDataFrame` to explicitly define a custom `bbox` and other parameters specific to the UDF.

```python showLineNumber
import geopandas as gpd

# Square AOI near Utah Lake
bbox = gpd.GeoDataFrame.from_features({"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":{"shape":"Rectangle"},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-112.01315665811222,40.13628586159681],[-111.89330615564467,40.13628586159681],[-111.89330615564467,40.004073791892196],[-112.01315665811222,40.004073791892196],[-112.01315665811222,40.13628586159681]]]}}]})
fused.run("fsh_46eSFZaR3q3SnoVB28pN0g", bbox=bbox, year=2020, crop_id=36)
```

### c. Parallelization

Invoke the UDF in parallel with `run_pool` to increase performance when you want to run it repeatedly with different input parameters. In this case, we'll use it to call the UDF across a set of years. For a deeper dive, read how to [Call UDFs asynchronously](/core-concepts/async/).

```python showLineNumber
import pandas as pd

def run_udf(year):
    gdf = fused.run("fsh_46eSFZaR3q3SnoVB28pN0g", bbox=bbox, year=year, crop_id=36)
    gdf['year'] = year
    return gdf

gdfs = fused.utils.common.run_pool(run_udf, [2019, 2020, 2021])
gdf_final = pd.concat(gdfs)
gdf_final
```

These examples show how you can easily integrate Fused into your analytics workflows. For example, you can group `gdf_final` by `GEOID` and `year` and calculate aggregates of the `count` and `stats` columns.

```python showLineNumber
gdfs.groupby(['GEOID', 'year']).agg({'count':'sum', 'stats': 'mean'}).reset_index()
```

## 5. Create an app

Now that you've created a UDF and explored different ways to invoke it, you can create a data app to share your results. We'll structure the HTTP endpoint you created above to act as a Tile server (with `/run/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}`), allowing it to be called from a [pydeck](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) `TileLayer` within the Fused App Builder. We'll also create a [Streamlit dropdown](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.selectbox) for users to set the year parameter.

## 6. Conclusion and next steps

We've shown how you can use Fused to develop a distributed Python workflow to power an app. Through a simple sequence of steps we loaded data, wrote analytics code, and created an app to interact with the data. With a single click you went from experimental development code to a live application.

We hope this overview gives you a glimpse of what you can build with Fused. You can continue to learn how to [get data in](/user-guide/in/), [transform data](/user-guide/transform/), and [integrate](/user-guide/out/) with other applications.
