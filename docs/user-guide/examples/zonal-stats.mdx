_A step-by-step guide for data scientists._

## 1. Introduction to Fused

Fused [Workbench](https://docs.fused.io/workbench/) is an end-to-end cloud platform for data analytics, built around User Defined Functions ([UDFs](/core-concepts/why/)) that can be invoked via HTTP requests.

- Run any Python code remotely within seconds
- Debug with instant feedback on a map
- Work with both vector and raster data
- Serve UDFs as HTTP endpoints
- Easily scale horizontally to hundreds of workers

You'll appreciate not having to set up any infrastructure because Fused takes your code and runs it in the cloud. The benefit is that there's zero configuration: you don't have to mess with clusters, Docker, or even an AWS account. Just bring your code.

In this guide, we'll introduce you to Fused by writing a simple zonal stats workflow. We'll explain Fused step by step: how to bring in your data, write a UDF to process the data, run the UDF remotely & in parallel, and create an app that invokes the UDF.

To get started, log in at [fused.io/workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench).

## 2. Bring in your data

In this guide, we'll estimate how much alfalfa growns in areas defined by buffers around polygon or point geometries. You'll first upload your own vector table with `fused.ingest`. This spatially partitions the table and writes it in your account's S3 bucket as a [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/). You'll then calculate zonal stats over a raster array of Alfalfa crops in the \[USDA Cropland Data Layer\]([https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/cropscape-cropland-data-layer](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/cropscape-cropland-data-layer)) (CDL) dataset.

This example ingests polygons of [U.S. Census Block Groups](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html) for Utah, but you can use any vector table you'd like. In this case, it's a parquet table with a `geometry` column. Read about other supported formats in [Ingest your own data](/core-concepts/content-management/Ingest/).

Pass the URL of the table to `fused.ingest`. When you kick-off an ingest job with `run_remote`, Fused spins up a server to partition your table and writes the output to your account's S3 bucket at the path specified by the `output` parameter. Open [fused.io/jobs](https://www.fused.io/jobs) to view the job status and logs.

```python showLineNumber
import fused

job = fused.ingest(input="https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2023/BG/tl_2023_49_bg.zip", output="s3://fused-asset/data/tl_2023_49_bg/")
job_id = job.run_remote()
```

If you run this in a Python environment, make sure to install the latest Fused SDK with `pip install fused` and authenticate. You can also ingest data without installing anything in this [Fused app](https://www.fused.io/workbench#app/s/i/fa_6XEw7ACaNo7Qtxggt6Cm9e). Once the job is complete, you can preview the output dataset in the [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/).

For the next step you can use the data you just ingested or, if you prefer, the data for the example which in in a publicly available path at `s3://fused-asset/data/`tl_2023_49_bg`/`.

## 3. Write a UDF to process the data

Let's first write a simple UDF that reads your data, prints a log to the console, and returns an output. To [write a UDF](/core-concepts/write/) simply wrap a Python function with `@fused.udf`. As you write code in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) you'll see how visualization results, logs, and errors show up immediately.

The first parameter of the UDF, `bbox`, is reserved for Fused to pass a `GeoDataFrame` defining the geometry to run the UDF for, typically a web map [tile](/core-concepts/filetile/). This enables Fused to run the UDF for each tile in the viewport - effectively distributing processing across multiple workers, which we'll cover more on below.

The `year` parameter is used to define the path of the CDL dataset which the utility function `read_tiff` loads for a given `bbox`.  The `crop_id` parameter 36 corresponds Alfalfa crop in the CDL \[colormap\]([https://storage.googleapis.com/earthengine-stac/catalog/USDA/USDA_NASS_CDL.json](https://storage.googleapis.com/earthengine-stac/catalog/USDA/USDA_NASS_CDL.json)).

Fused lets you import utility Modules from other UDFs with `fused.utils`.

- `read_tiff` loads an array of the CDL dataset for the specified `year` and `bbox, and creates arr`
- `table_to_tile` loads a fraction of the geo partitioned table for a given `bbox, and creates gdf [TODO]`
- `geom_stats` calculates zonal statistics for the `gdf` and `arr` inputs

  Use print statements, such as `print(arr`) to show logs in the console.

```python showLineNumber
@fused.udf
def udf(
    bbox: fused.types.TileGDF=None, 
    year="2020",
    crop_id=75
):
    import numpy as np
    
    # Load CDLS data
    input_tiff_path = f"s3://fused-asset/data/cdls/{year}_30m_cdls.tif"
    arr = fused.utils.common.read_tiff(bbox, input_tiff_path)

    # Mask for crops
    mask = np.isin(arr, [crop_id], invert=True)
    arr[mask] = 0
    
    # Load polygons
    table = 's3://fused-asset/data/tl_2023_49_bg/'
    cols = ['NAMELSAD', 'MTFCC', 'FUNCSTAT', 'geometry']
    gdf = fused.utils.common.table_to_tile(bbox, table, min_zoom=5, clip=False, use_columns=cols)
    gdf.crs = 4326

    # Calculate zonal stats
    gdf_zonal = fused.utils.common.geom_stats(gdf, arr)
    return gdf_zonal
```

Try running the UDF in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) and visually inspect the output on the map. See what happens when you change `year` and add more `print` statements.

## 4. Run the UDF remotely and in parallel

Now that you have a UDF, let's see three ways you can [Run UDFs](/core-concepts/run/) remotely: via an HTTP endpoint, in a Python application, and in parallel.

### a. HTTP endpoint

Save the UDF and greate an HTTP endpoint for the UDF by clicking "Share" in the UDF Settings tab. You'll see snippets to call the UDF from anywhere using a [shared token](/core-concepts/run/#shared-token). Try this by changing the HTTP endpoint snippet's query parameter as shown and pasting the URL in a new tab. You should see the output in GeoJSON format.

```javascript
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_46eSFZaR3q3SnoVB28pN0g/run/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?dtype_out_vector=geojson&year=2021&crop_type=36
```

#### What just happened?

When you called the HTTP endpoint, Fused ran the UDF then sent back the output table and [debug logs](/core-concepts/write/#http-requests). In the URL above, `/11/330/757` specifies the ZXY tile index to pass through `bbox`, `dtype_out_vector=geojson` specifies the output format, and the `year` & `crop_type` parameters let you run the UDF for different years and crop types.

#### Why does this matter?

You called the HTTP endpoint with a shared token, which means any application may call the UDF and get data back without needing to authenticate. You also passed parameters to the UDF, which enables you to dynamically generate data and define its output format.

To start seeing the full power of Fused, change the UDF code and call the endpoint again. You'll see the UDF automatically updates. When you call the UDF again it should run even faster.

### b. Python SDK

The share token also enables you to run the UDF in a Python environment. You can specify `bbox` as the same map tile as above by passing `x`, `y`, and `z` parameters.

```python showLineNumber
import fused
fused.run("fsh_46eSFZaR3q3SnoVB28pN0g", x=776, y=1553, z=12)
```

You can also explicitly define the `bbox` with a `GeoDataFrame` for an AOI.

```python showLineNumber
iimport geopandas as gpd

# Square AOI near Utah Lake
bbox = gpd.GeoDataFrame.from_features({"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":{"shape":"Rectangle"},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-112.01315665811222,40.13628586159681],[-111.89330615564467,40.13628586159681],[-111.89330615564467,40.004073791892196],[-112.01315665811222,40.004073791892196],[-112.01315665811222,40.13628586159681]]]}}]})
fused.run("fsh_46eSFZaR3q3SnoVB28pN0g", bbox=bbox)
```

### c. Parallelization

Invoke the UDF in parallel with `run_pool` to effortlessly increase performance when you want to run it repeatedly with different input parameters. In this case, we'll use it to call the UDF across multiple years. For a deeper dive, read how to [Call UDFs asynchronously](/core-concepts/async/).

```python
import pandas as pd

def run_udf(year):
    gdf = fused.run("fsh_46eSFZaR3q3SnoVB28pN0g", bbox=bbox, year=year, crop_id=36)
    gdf['year'] = year
    return gdf

gdfs = fused.utils.common.run_pool(run_udf, [2019, 2020, 2021])
gdfs = pd.concat(gdfs)
gdfs
```

## 5. Create an app

Now that you've created a UDF explored different ways to call it, you're ready to create a data app to share your results with a broader audience. We'll structure the HTTP endpoint you created above to act as a Tile server, allowing it to be called from a `pydeck` map within the Fused App Builder. We'll also create a dropdown so users can select which year to run the UDF for.

import Iframe from "@site/src/components/Iframe";
import CODE from "@site/src/app-iframe/python/example_zstats.py";

## 6. Conclusion and next steps

We've shown how you can use Fused to develop a distributed Python workflow to power an app. Through simple steps we were able to load data, write analytics operations, and create an app to interact with the data. With a single click went from experimental development code to a live application.

We hope this overview gives you a glimpse of what you can build with Fused. You can continue to learn how to [get data in](https://docs.fused.io/user-guide/in/), [transform data](https://docs.fused.io/user-guide/transform/), and [integrate](https://docs.fused.io/user-guide/out/) with other applications.
