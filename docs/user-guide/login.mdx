Here's a quick guide to help you log into Fused using Google or GitHub, and how to fix any account setup scenarios you might run into

## Step 1: Sign up for Fused

:::warning
Fused is currently in private beta. 

To join, sign up for the [waitlist](https://forms.gle/6Qrd2nnSDvZPGZXs5) and coordinate with the Fused team to ensure your account is properly set up. 

Once your account is confirmed, you'll be able to log in.
:::

## Step 2: Choose how to log in

Visit the login page here: [fused.io/workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench) and follow the authentication flow. You can log into Fused using:
1. Google Email
2. GitHub

import ImgLoginflow from '@site/static/img/login_flow.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImgLoginflow} alt="File" style={{width: 600}} />
</div>


{/* :::info
Some email providers may use aliases which could make your email appear differently during login. [Check User Preferences](/core-concepts/login/#2-check-user-preferences) to view see the email associated with the authenticated account.

## Troubleshoot authentication issues

Follow these steps if you encounter any issues logging into Fused or executing UDFs.

### 1. Try to run a UDF

To verify if your account is active, navigate to the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) then [create](/workbench/udf-catalog/#new-udf) and run a User Defined Function (UDF). If your account is configured correctly, the map should show "Changes pending" and begin to render the UDF output. If you see the following error message, the email you used to sign in may not be associated with an active execution environment.

```text
Access is not configured for you in the Fused Workbench.

Please refresh the page if you think this is an error,
or get in touch if you require further help.

Cause: Realtime instance not configured.
```

import ImgUdf from '@site/static/img/login_udf.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImgUdf} alt="File" style={{width: 600}} />
</div>


### 2. Check User Preferences

Go to your account settings and confirm your preferences, especially if you're getting any errors about your execution environment.

import Imgprofile from '@site/static/img/login_profile.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={Imgprofile} alt="File" style={{width: 600}} />
</div>

### 3. Contact the Fused team for further assistance

If the issue persists, reach out to the Fused team for further assistance. Provide them with screenshots or error messages to help them diagnose the problem.
