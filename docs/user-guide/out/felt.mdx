[Felt](https://felt.com/) is an interactive and collaborative map making platform. Teams use it to quickly create stunning map visualizations - without needing to move data around nor install software. 

Felt supports a number of [file formats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgadqdMMYp0&ab_channel=Felt), some of which can originate from hosted URLs. Fused UDFs can be configured to return data in some of those formats - all it takes is a simple URL call.

</div>


To follow along, you'll need a Felt account - which you can create for free.

To load data from Fused, you'll first generate a signed UDF URL.

## 1. Generate a signed URL for a UDF

First, on Workbench, create and save a UDF. Under the "Settings" tab, click "Share" to [generate a signed URL](/basics/utilities/#generate-endpoints-with-workbench) that can be called via HTTP requests. 

Modify the generated `HTTP` URL depending on the data type, as detailed below. You can optionally pass UDF parameters as URL-encoded strings, which can be configured to change based on query input.

## 2. Load data into Felt

There's 2 ways to load data from Fused into Felt, depending on whether the UDF returns a raster or vector data type. Both are passed through the "Upload from URL" modal, but require particular URL structures. Read the [Felt docs](https://feltmaps.notion.site/Upload-Anything-b26d739e80184127872faa923b55d232#3e37f06bc38c4971b435fbff2f4da6cb) for a deeper dive into this feature.

### Raster Tiles

Dynamically render XYZ raster tiles on the Felt map.

As an example, the ["Sentinel Tile Example"](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/Sentinel_Tile_Example) public UDF returns an XYZ tile URL of NDVI from the Sentinel dataset. Create a new instance of it on your workbench and ensure it successfully renders data under `Tile` mode. Next, generate a shared URL and moddify it as such:

- Set `dtype_out_raster` to `png`.
- Set replace the values after `/run/tiles` with the `/{z}/{x}/{y}` template.
- Set UDF parameters as needed.

For example:


```bash
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/da71c7bf79376f2e88b37be9ecd2679f2e40a5b79f9b0f2c75e7ea9a3f0c5171/run/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?dtype_out_raster=png
```

This should render the raster output tiles on the map. This example shows NDVI on the area surrounding the Panama Canal.

### Vector

Load vector data in a one-off manner onto the Felt map.

As an example, the ["Single Route"](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/single_route) public UDF returns a composite vector line of driving directions between an origin and destination locations. Create a new instance of it on your workbench and ensure it successfully renders data under `File` mode. Next, generate a shared URL and modify it as such:

- Set `dtype_out_vector` to `csv` or `parquet`.
- Set UDF parameters as needed.

For example:
```bash
https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/4f8fe6b81811ce011d7045b9fffbcfb43663637a4c626955821566fe62e6fb57/run/file?dtype_out_vector=csv&lat_start=35.0154145&lng_start=-114.2253804&lat_end=33.9422&lng_end=-114.4036
```


Click "Upload from URL", paste the URL, and click "Add to map".



This should load the data and render it on the map.

</div>

Note that once the data is loaded, it's cached in the Felt platform so it won't be affected by modifications to the UDF.
