# Kepler

[Kepler](https://kepler.gl/) is a powerful open source too to visualize large geospatial datasets. Data analysts use it to create data-driven maps, gain insights from location data, and embed dynamic maps into custom applications.

The UDF Builder can load the data returned by a UDF call into Kepler. When visualizing a vector dataset, click "Open in Kepler.gl" button located on the top-right menu of the map, wait for data to be transferred and then click "Open in Kepler.gl" in the bottom-right.
