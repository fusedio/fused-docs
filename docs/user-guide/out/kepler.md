[Kepler](https://kepler.gl/) is a powerful open source too to visualize large geospatial datasets. Data analysts use it to create stunning data-driven maps, gain insights from location data, and embed dynamic maps into custom applications.

With Fused Workbench, you can now easily export fractions of datasets to Kepler.

When visualizing a vector dataset, simply click the "Open in Kepler.gl" button on the top-right menu of the map. This will open a Kepler map with the data for the center tile on a new tab.
