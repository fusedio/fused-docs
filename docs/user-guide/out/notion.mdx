# Notion

_Embed responsive apps directly inside a Notion page._


## 1. Create an app with [Fused App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/)

We assume you already have created an app with [Fused App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/app-overview/). The next step is to:
- Save your app (either click "Save" like for [saving a UDF](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/#save-a-udfs) or hit `Cmd + S` / `Ctrl + S`)
- Similar to [sharing a UDF](/workbench/udf-builder/navigation/#share) click the "Share" tab and create a shareable token. 

This will give you a URL link like: `https://www.fused.io/app/fsh...`

## 2. Embed the map into Notion

On a Notion page, type `/embed` to create an [embed component](https://www.notion.so/help/embed-and-connect-other-apps). Paste the app URL in the menu that appears. You may publish the page as a [Notion site](https://www.notion.so/help/public-pages-and-web-publishing).
