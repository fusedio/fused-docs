# Get started with Fused! 🚀


Learn the fundamental concepts of working with Fused.

This guide is an introduction to Fused Workbench. It covers the concepts and terminology you will come across as you work with data using the web-based IDE. After reading this page you should have an understanding of the fundamentals to build Fused UDFs and apps.

## Introduction

A Fused UDF is a Python function that interacts with your data and can be called via HTTP requests. You create UDFs from cloud storage files with the File Explorer, or clone them from the UDF Catalog. You edit UDFs in the UDF Builder and create apps that interact with your UDFs in the App Builder.

## Create an account

Sign up for a Fused account at [fused.io/workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench).


## Bring your data



## Create UDF to read a File

The [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/) is where you browse and preview files in cloud storage.

Upload your data to your organization's S3 bucket with the File Explorer then browse to the file. When the map is zoomed-out, you'll notice boxes showing up corresponding to the spatial extent of each file. As you zoom in, the boxes will give way to the polygons of the Census Block Groups. Clicking on individual files will show the polygons they contain.






Double-click or browse the file's kebab menu to open a new UDF that reads the file in the UDF Builder.


## Open a UDF from the Catalog

The [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog/) is where you browse UDFs and preview their metadata. Click "Add to Workbench" in the UDF's menu to open it in the UDF Builder.


## Edit a UDF

The UDF Builder is where you write Python to edit UDFs. The map visualization updates in real-time as you edit the code. You load and transform data with libraries such as [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) and [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/).

As an example, copy this UDF into the UDF Builder to render subway stations on a map:


```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import geopandas as gpd
    import requests
    DATASET = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-visualization/folium-example-data/main/subway_stations.geojson'
    gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame.from_features(requests.get(DATASET).json())
    return gdf
```

You can customize the data, logs, and output columns.

1. Change the `DATASET` to `"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-visualization/folium-example-data/main/us_states.json"` to read U.S. states
2. Add `print(gdf)` before the `return` statement to preview the GeoDataFrame in the logs
3. Filter the GeoDataFrame with `gdf = gdf[gdf['name'].isin(['California', 'Texas'])]` to keep only California and Texas




## Create an app

When you save a UDF, click "Share" in settings to create a shareable token you can use to call the UDF. Paste the token in the input field of this [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/) and press "Enter" to see the output of the UDF in the app.

Click "Copy shareable link" to create a URL to easily share the app.

## Next steps

Congratulations, you're off to a great start with Fused. 🎉

- Load data from [Google Earth Engine](/user-guide/in/gee/) and [DuckDB](/user-guide/in/duckdb/)
- Run operations like [buffer analysis](/user-guide/transform/geospatial/buffer/)
- Load data into [Lonboard](/user-guide/out/lonboard/) or [Streamlit](/user-guide/out/streamlit/), and [much more](/user-guide/transform/geospatial/)
- Join [Discord](https://bit.ly/fused-discord) to connect with the community and discover what's possible
- Once you feel ready, [share](/python-sdk/contribute/) your UDFs with the community

Welcome aboard! 🚢
