# Get started with Fused! üöÄ


Fused Workbench is the unified platform to build with data.

Data analysis often starts with browsing and previewing files, processing and transforming data, and then sharing the results. This quickstart will walk you through just that.

First you'll browse and preview datasets in an S3 bucket with the [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/). Then you'll create a UDF from one of those files and edit it in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/). Finally you'll create an app in the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/) to interact with the UDF.

If you want to follow along, you can open Workbench at [fused.io/workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench) to get started.

## Workbench in 2 minutes ‚è∞

### 1. Browse files


### 2. Create a UDF that opens a file


### 3. Edit the UDF


### 4. Create an app to interact with the UDF




## What's next?

Congratulations, you're off to a great start with Fused. üéâ

- Load data from [Google Earth Engine](/user-guide/in/gee/) and [DuckDB](/user-guide/in/duckdb/)
- Run operations like [buffer analysis](/user-guide/transform/geospatial/buffer/)
- Load data into [Lonboard](/user-guide/out/lonboard/) or [Streamlit](/user-guide/out/streamlit/), and [much more](/user-guide/transform/geospatial/)
- Join [Discord](https://bit.ly/fused-discord) to connect with the community and discover what's possible
- Once you feel ready, [share](/python-sdk/contribute/) your UDFs with the community

Welcome aboard! üö¢
