# Get started with Fused! üöÄ


Data analysis often begins with browsing and previewing files, proceeds to processing and transforming data, and culminates with sharing the results. This quickstart will walk you through that sequence of steps using Fused.

First you'll browse and preview datasets in an S3 bucket with the [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/). Next you'll create a UDF from one of those files and edit it in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/). Finally you'll create an app in the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/) to interact with the UDF. As a bonus step, you'll see how to easily open a UDF from the public [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog/).

To follow along, open Workbench at [fused.io/workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench) to get started.

Congratulations, you're off to a great start with Fused. üéâ

- Load data from [Google Earth Engine](/user-guide/in/gee/) and [DuckDB](/user-guide/in/duckdb/)
- Run operations like [buffer analysis](/user-guide/transform/geospatial/buffer/)
- Load data into [Lonboard](/user-guide/out/lonboard/) or [Streamlit](/user-guide/out/streamlit/), and [much more](/user-guide/transform/geospatial/)
- Join [Discord](https://bit.ly/fused-discord) to connect with the community and discover what's possible
- Once you feel ready, [share](/python-sdk/contribute/) your UDFs with the community

Welcome aboard! üö¢
