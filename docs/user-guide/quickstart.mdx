# Get started with Fused! 🚀


Learn the fundamental concepts of working with Fused.

This guide is an introduction to Fused Workbench. It covers the concepts and terminology you will come across as you work with data using the web-based IDE. After reading this page you should have an understanding of the fundamentals to build Fused UDFs and apps.

## Introduction

A Fused User Defined Function ([UDF](/core-concepts/why/)) is a Python function that interacts with your data and can be called via HTTP requests. You can create UDFs from cloud storage files with the [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/) or clone existing UDFs from the [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog/). You edit UDFs in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) and create & share apps that interact with your UDFs in the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/).

## Create an account

Sign up for a Fused account at [fused.io/workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench).



## Create UDF to read your data

The [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/) is where you browse and preview files in cloud storage.

Upload your data to your organization's S3 bucket with the File Explorer then browse to the file. Double-click or browse the file's kebab menu to open a new UDF that reads the file in the UDF Builder.

Take, for example, U.S. Census Block Groups in `s3://fused-asset/infra/census_bg_us/`. If you select the directory you'll notice that, when the map is zoomed-out, the spatial extent of the geometries in the dataset is shown as bounding boxes. As you zoom in, the boxes will give way to the polygons of the Census Block Groups. Clicking on individual files will show the polygons they contain.

## Open a UDF from the Catalog

Fused's [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog/) contains dozens of public UDFs to help you kickstart your next project. Browse through UDFs, preview their metadata, and click 'Add to Workbench' to open a UDF in the UDF Builder.

## Edit a UDF

The UDF Builder is the IDE to edit UDFs. Data can be loaded and transformed with Python libraries such as [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) and [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/). As code changes, the map visualization updates in real-time.

As an example, copy this UDF into the UDF Builder to render subway stations on a map:


```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import geopandas as gpd
    import requests
    DATASET = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-visualization/folium-example-data/main/subway_stations.geojson'
    gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame.from_features(requests.get(DATASET).json())
    return gdf
```

You can customize the data, logs, and output columns.

1. Change the `DATASET` to `"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-visualization/folium-example-data/main/us_states.json"` to read U.S. states
2. Add `print(gdf)` before the `return` statement to preview the GeoDataFrame in the logs
3. Filter the GeoDataFrame with `gdf = gdf[gdf['name'].isin(['California', 'Texas'])]` to keep only California and Texas




## Create an app

Use Streamlit components to create an app in the App Builder. Click "Copy shareable link" to create a URL to easily share the app.

## Next steps

Congratulations, you're off to a great start with Fused. 🎉

- Load data from [Google Earth Engine](/user-guide/in/gee/) and [DuckDB](/user-guide/in/duckdb/)
- Run operations like [buffer analysis](/user-guide/transform/geospatial/buffer/)
- Load data into [Lonboard](/user-guide/out/lonboard/) or [Streamlit](/user-guide/out/streamlit/), and [other popular applications](/user-guide/transform/geospatial/)
- Join [Discord](https://bit.ly/fused-discord) to connect with the community and discover what's possible
- Once you feel ready, [share](/python-sdk/contribute/) your UDFs with the community

Welcome aboard! 🚢
