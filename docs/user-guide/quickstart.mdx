# Get started with Fused! 🚀



The Fused Workbench is designed to streamline data analytics.

Data analysis often begins with browsing and previewing files, continues to processing and transforming data, and culminates with sharing the results. This quickstart showcases Workbench while taking you through this sequence of data analysis steps.


## Workbench in 2 minutes ⏰


First you'll browse and preview a dataset in an S3 bucket with the [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/). Next you'll create a UDF from one of those files and edit it in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/). Finally you'll create an app in the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/) to interact with the UDF.

To follow along, open Workbench at [fused.io/workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench) to get started.

### 1. Browse files

The [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/) is where you browse and preview files in cloud storage. Go to the File Explorer and navigate to the `s3://fused-asset/infra/census_bg_us/` S3 object path where you'll find the [U.S. Census Block Group](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/) dataset. When the map is zoomed-out, you'll notice boxes showing up corresponding to the spatial extent of each file. As you zoom in, the boxes will give way to the actual geometries of the Census Block Groups. Clicking on individual files will show their content.




### 2. Create a UDF that opens a file

Select a file within the directory. Click "New Pandas Parquet UDF"  in its menu to open a new UDF that reads the file. A UDF will open in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/), where you can edit the UDF and preview its output.


### 3. Edit the UDF to transform data

Edit the code to perform a simple transformaiton. Add this line to the UDF above the return statement to filter for Census Block Groups with water area greater than 0 square meters.

```python showLineNumbers
df = df[df['AWATER'] > 0]
```


### 4. Create and share and app that calls the UDF

Save the UDF, and click "Share" in settings to create a shareable token you can use to call the UDF. Paste the token in the input field of this [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/) and press "Enter" to see the output of the UDF in the app.

## What's next?

Congratulations, you're off to a great start with Fused. 🎉

- Load data from [Google Earth Engine](/user-guide/in/gee/) and [DuckDB](/user-guide/in/duckdb/)
- Run operations like [buffer analysis](/user-guide/transform/geospatial/buffer/)
- Load data into [Lonboard](/user-guide/out/lonboard/) or [Streamlit](/user-guide/out/streamlit/), and [much more](/user-guide/transform/geospatial/)
- Join [Discord](https://bit.ly/fused-discord) to connect with the community and discover what's possible
- Once you feel ready, [share](/python-sdk/contribute/) your UDFs with the community

Welcome aboard! 🚢
