description: Use HTTP Requests with Fused!

# Get started with Fused! 🚀

Fused makes it easy to build and ship apps with any-size data. Fused UDFs are Python building blocks to fuse any data, with any tool, at any scale. 


- [Write](/core-concepts/write/) UDFs in the Fused [Workbench](/workbench/overview/)
- [Run](/core-concepts/run/) UDFs from your stack with [HTTP endpoints](/core-concepts/run/#http-requests)
- Create and instantly share [Fused apps](/workbench/app-builder/) powered by UDFs
- Run UDFs in Jupyter notebooks with the [Python SDK](/python-sdk) 

## Workbench in 2 minutes ⏱️

The Workbench is the unified platform to browse S3 datasets, discover and write UDFs, and build apps. It integrates four applications that work together to streamline how teams work with data. A typical workflow might start with previewing a file in an S3 bucket, creating a UDF to process the data, and then building an interactive app to share the results.

Continue for an overview of each application and launch [Workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench) to get started.

### UDF explorer

Easily browse public or team UDFs, and clone them into the Map builder.


### Map builder

The Map builder takes developers from code to map. Write UDFs in the code editor, preview the output on the map, and create HTTP endpoints to run UDFs.


### App builder

Quickly build and share apps that can run UDFs. 



### File explorer

Browse S3 buckets and directly open objects as UDFs. 




## Next steps

### Load a public UDF

To play with a more complex UDF, browse the UDF catalog and clone a UDF into your editor. A good beginner example is the "NSI Overture" UDF, which performs a [point-in-polygon](/transform/geospatial/point-in-polygon/) operation between the NSI (National Structures Inventory) point and the Overture building footprints datasets. 

### Create an app

Create an app that runs your UDF in the [App builder](/workbench/app-builder/). Assemble the app with [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference) components, and share it with others by clicking the "Copy shareable link" button.


## What's next?

Congratulations, you're off to a great start with Fused. 🎉

- This quickstart is just the beginning
- Load data from [Google Earth Engine](/user-guide/in/gee/) and [DuckDB](/user-guide/in/duckdb/)
- Run operations like [buffer analysis](/user-guide/transform/geospatial/buffer/)
- Load data into [Lonboard](/user-guide/out/lonboard/) or [Streamlit](/user-guide/out/streamlit/), and [much more](/user-guide/tutorials/)
- Join [Discord](https://bit.ly/fused-discord) to connect with the community and discover what's possible
- Once you feel ready, [share your UDFs with the community](/python-sdk/contribute/)

Welcome aboard! 🚢
