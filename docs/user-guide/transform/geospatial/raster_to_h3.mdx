# Raster to Hexagon

_Transforming raster data into [H3 cells](https://h3geo.org/)_

![Raster to H3](/img/user-guide/tranforms/Raster-Hexagon.png)

## When to use

Transforming raster data into H3 cells is useful when you need to:
- Want to have spatial statistics about a raster (heatmap like visualization)
- A fast way to run statistics across different disparate datasets by combining them all to hexagons

## Code implementation

We've made a [Public UDF](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Hexagonify_raster_from_url-f25c9896-739c-4f8e-b693-38fbb0d9f4ad) `Hexagonify_raster_from_url` that you can use in your own UDFs or any workflow.

:::note
To call a [public UDF](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#public-udf-name) you need to use the prefix `UDF_` in front of the name. 

This allows you to run this UDF without needing an environment setup on your account.
:::

```python showLineNumbers
hex_df = fused.run(
    "UDF_Hexagonify_raster_from_url",
    raster_path="https://s3.amazonaws.com/elevation-tiles-prod/geotiff/4/4/6.tif", 
    stats_type="mean", 
    h3_res=4
)
```

## Example application

- [DEM_Tile_Hexify](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/DEM_Tile_Hexify-c9aae65c-0047-42ba-8b3c-4326a5a2e47b) Public UDF. 
    - This UDF takes a Raster Tile from an open S3 bucket containing an elevation model and converts a tile into H3 on the fly
