# Zonal Statistics: A Comprehensive Guide

Zonal statistics calculates aggregate statistics (e.g., mean, sum, maximum) of the pixel values of a raster that fall within areas defined by a `Polygon` dataset. The method has diverse applications such as determining vegetation health in an agricultural field, assessing surface water availability, or approximating building heights from DSM rasters.

## Applications

- Height approximation: Estimate the height of buildings from DSM
- Crop yield estimation: Determine vegetation health within crop polygons using NDVI rasters
- Water resource management: Assess surface water availability in watersheds using NDWI rasters
- Forestry: Track changes in forest cover over time within administrative boundaries


## Implementing zonal statistics

The analysis involves first determining the pixels that within a polygon then can calculating their aggregate statistics such as their count, mean, sum, or maximum.

### Implementation steps

To perform this operation, first load a raster and a vector datasets for spatially overlapping areas then, then perform zonal aggregations as shows below using the `xarray` and `GeoPandas` libraries.

1. Load overlapping the raster and vector data
2. For the extent of each `Polygon`, clip the raster to create a mask array
3. Perform an aggregation operation (e.g., mean, sum, max) on each masked array
4. Return the results in a `GeoDataFrame`, where each row corresponds to a `Polygon` and the a columns contain the value for the aggregate zonal statistics


### Example UDF

This example UDF loads the building footprint table `gdf` and DSM raster `arr` from S3 only for a section defined by `bbox`, which corresponds to a map tile. It then calculates the zonal statistics, and returns the results as the `GeoDataFrame` `gdf_zonal`. This process enables Fused workbench to perform the calculation dynamically as users scroll and zoom in the map.

```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(
    bbox: fused.types.TileGDF=None, min_zoom=15, table="s3://fused-asset/infra/building_msft_us/"
):
    dsm_to_tile = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/eda5aec/public/DSM_JAXA_Example").utils.dsm_to_tile
    utils = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/2a76b6a/public/common/").utils

    gdf = utils.table_to_tile(bbox, table, min_zoom)
    arr = dsm_to_tile(bbox, z_levels=[4, 6, 9, 11], verbose=False)
    gdf_zonal = utils.geom_stats(gdf, arr)
    return gdf_zonal
```

The UDF would return a `GeoDataFrame` like the following, with an aggregate `stats` column for each input `Polygon`:

                                                geometry      stats  count
660    POLYGON ((-122.39806 37.76221, -122.39806 37.7...      22.00      5
661    POLYGON ((-122.39881 37.76219, -122.39876 37.7...      21.99    193
1452   POLYGON ((-122.39619 37.76326, -122.39613 37.7...      13.50      2
1458   POLYGON ((-122.39774 37.76327, -122.39776 37.7...      11.00     28
3033   POLYGON ((-122.39680 37.76362, -122.39701 37.7...      10.20      5
...
```


## Conclusion

While zonal statistics is a valuable tool, it's often just the starting point for more complex analyses. Combining zonal statistics with other techniques such time series analysis or machine learning approaches can provide even richer insights into your data.
