# Overture Buildings

Welcome! This Notebook designed to perform a spatial query on the Overture Buildings
dataset.

The original dataset is several GB in size. The Fused User Defined Function (UDF) below
fetches only the buildings that fall within the area of interest. This means you can use
this code to simplify your workflows by loading only the fraction of data you care
about.

The Notebook shows how to:

1. Define an area of interest by drawing a polygon on a Leaflet map
1. Perform a spatial query over the dataset with a UDF
1. View the output on a map

It shows examples for using both `ipyleaflet` and `geemap`.

Let's begin!

```python
# !pip install fused ipyleaflet geopandas -q
```

```python
# If on colab, Enable the ipyleaflet widget (might require restarting the kernel)

# !pip install ipywidgets==7.7.1 -q
# from google.colab import output
# output.enable_custom_widget_manager()
```

# 1. Load Fused UDF

This User Defined Function (UDF) queries a geo partitioned version of the Overture
Buildings Dataset (hosted on an S3 bucket) that corresponds to the area of an input
GeoDataFrame. It returns a GeoDataFrame containing the subsampled data, which gets
cached to the local environment for added speed.

```python
import fused
import geopandas as gpd
from shapely.geometry import shape

# Create a map centered at the given location
MAP_LOCATION = (37.7749, -122.4194)
```

```python
udf = fused.load(
    "https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/0905bef/public/Overture_Maps_Example"
)
```

# 2. Draw polygon to query buildings

## ipyleaflet

Draw a polygon around the AOI and on the map and wait for building polygons to load.

Note: the workflow is designed to work with a single polygon.

```python
from ipyleaflet import DrawControl, GeoData, Map, basemap_to_tiles, basemaps

m = Map(
    layers=(basemap_to_tiles(basemaps.OpenStreetMap.Mapnik),),
    center=MAP_LOCATION,
    zoom=13,
)


def on_draw(self, action, geo_json):
    print("Running...")
    gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(
        index=[0], crs="epsg:4326", geometry=[shape(geo_json.get("geometry"))]
    )
    gdf_buildings = udf(bbox=gdf).run_local()
    m.add(GeoData(geo_dataframe=gdf_buildings))
    print("Done!")


draw_control = DrawControl()
draw_control.on_draw(on_draw)
draw_control.polygon = {
    "shapeOptions": {"color": "red", "fillOpacity": 0.0},
    "drawError": {"color": "#dd253b", "message": "Oups!"},
    "allowIntersection": False,
}

draw_control.rectangle = {"shapeOptions": {"color": "red", "fillOpacity": 0.0}}

m.add(draw_control)
```

```python

```
