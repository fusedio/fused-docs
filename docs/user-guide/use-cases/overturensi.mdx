This use case shows how to join the [Overture Buildings](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/buildings/#14/32.58453/-117.05154/0/60) dataset with the [NSI](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/confluence/nsi/) dataset using a [point in polygon](/user-guide/transform/geospatial/point-in-polygon/) operation. Overture has polygon geometries, NSI has info on risk, by joining them we have spatially aware dataset


This can provide a rich set of information of risk distribution across broad urban areas or a portfolio of assets.



## Introduction
In geospatial analysis, enriching data by joining multiple datasets can unlock new insights and enable more informed decisionmaking. The Overture Buildings dataset is a global collection of building footprints that is commonly used to enrich datasets with spatial representation of build environments. Analysts commonly add data on top of this datasets to create perspectives around different use cases such as identifying buildings within flood zones, assess infrastructure risk, or conduct detailed marken analysis.

Joining the Buliding footprints with the National Structure Inventory (NSI) dataset can provide a rich set of information of risk distribution across broad urban areas or a portfolio of assets.



## ...Why?




## Datasets


- The Buildings data schema includes the building footprint `Polygons` and a small set of properties (e.g. building category, height, name).

- The NSI dataset includes rich information of man-made structures in USA. The data schema includes building location `Points`, function, and attributes related to risk management.


## UDF: Point in Polygon

This UDF performs a spatial join between the Overture Building Footprints and the National Structures Inventory (NSI) datasets, enriching the building footprints with additional attributes from the NSI dataset within a specified bounding box. The result is a GeoDataFrame that combines the spatial data from both sources, retaining the polygon geometries of the building footprints.


```python showLineNumbers
@fused.udf
def udf(bbox: fused.types.TileGDF = None):
    # Load datasets
    utils = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/Nsi_Overture").utils
    gdf_overture = utils.load_overture_gdf(bbox, overture_type="building")
    gdf_nsi = utils.load_nsi_gdf(bbox)

    # Spatial join - keeps the polygon geometry
    return gdf_overture.sjoin(gdf_nsi)
```

##### [stash]

overture aims to keep the dataset up to date if buildings change, so can keep datasets up to date by joining. usings GERS (The Global Entity Reference System (GERS) is a framework for structuring, encoding, and matching map data to a shared universal reference. )

todo: link, size, number of points


App:
DESCRIPTION WHAT IS THIS, show it for a small town.
TABLE: compare neighborhoods in a table, top 10 value buildings

Get it right bc this is the template for others to follow.


Structure first.

What is point in polygon, why does it matter. A cookiecutter.
