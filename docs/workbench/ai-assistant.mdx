# AI Assistant

The AI Assistant is a tool that allows you to use AI to help you code directly in the Workbench.

### Get Started with the AI Assistant

1. Open the AI Assistant tab
2. Type your prompt! (Or click the "microphone" icon to directly speak your prompt!)
3. See your results! (or press Shift + Enter if it didn't auto run)

### What it can help you with

AI Assistant sees all the UDFs you have open in Workbench. So AI Assistant can help you:
- Fix your queries 
- Create code to load data you don't know how to load 

### Tips & Tricks

- Ask as specific questions as possible. The more precise your query, the more likely you are to get a response you like.
- Try out the suggestions! Our models auto suggest what you could do next based on all your code
- Ask crazy things you don’t know how to do!
- Come back tomorrow, we'll most certainly have some new stuff! 🧑‍💻

### Personalize your AI Assistant

Pass a custom prompt to the AI Assistant based on your preferences:

- Click the ⚙️ icon in the top right corner
- Add your custom prompt
- Click "Save"

Examples of custom prompts:

```text
I'm a data scientist familiar with Python, don't put comments for basic code
```

```text
Use DuckDB for most queries whenever possible rather than Pandas
```

### Examples
