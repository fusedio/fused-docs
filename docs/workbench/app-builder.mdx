The App Builder transforms UDFs into interactive, shareable apps.

Data scientists often need to make analytics interactive and accessible to broader audiences. However, building traditional React apps with maps and widgets can be inefficient, especially if prototypes might be discarded. Additionally, frontend frameworks are not well-suited for transforming data or handling large datasets.


With this in mind, the App Builder enables users to build and run apps with [serverless Streamlit](https://github.com/whitphx/stlite), an open source framework to deliver dynamic data apps with just a few lines of Python.

{/* Read more about the synergy between Streamlit and Fused [here](https://blog.fused.io/2021/11/09/streamlit-fused/). */}

## Build apps

You build apps by writing Python in the code editor, shown below. As you write code you'll notice the app automatically reruns as code and widgets change (configurable in the settings).

You may add [input widgets](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/widgets) that interact with UDFs, display data with [data](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data) and [text](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/text) elements, and structure the app with [layout components](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/layout).

import Iframe from "@site/src/components/Iframe";
import CODE from "@site/src/app-iframe/python/basic.py";

<Iframe
  id="iframe-1"
  code={CODE}
  requirements={[
    "/pyarrow/pyarrow-17.0.0-cp312-cp312-pyodide_2024_0_wasm32.whl",
    "micropip",
    "pyodide-unix-timezones", // needed by pyarrow
    "requests",
    "yarl",
    "pydeck",

\
Try running the code snippets below to acquaint yourself with the App Builder.


```python
import streamlit as st

st.write("Hello, *Fused!* :rocket:")
```






## Dependencies

Click "Requirements" on the top-right menu of the code editor to set Python packages for the app. This is limited to packages compatible with [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/). Please get in touch if you need help with a specific package.


Furthermore, it can be useful to build apps without pre-installed dependencies. Use [micropip](https://pypi.org/project/micropip/) to install packages at runtime. When using this approach, `requests` must be installed before `fused_app` is imported. This is also useful for [GitHub Gists](/workbench/app-builder/#github-gists), which cannot install dependencies ahead of execution.


```python
import micropip
await micropip.install("requests")
await micropip.install("pydeck")
import fused_app
import pydeck as pdk
```




## Troubleshoot

Click "Reset app" on the top-right menu of the code editor in case things aren't working as expected.

## Call Fused UDFs

Apps may call UDFs and load their output into memory. This enables them to run resource-intensive operations and use libraries unsupported by Pyodide. These snippets illustrate a few ways to call UDFs.

### With `fused_app.run` (beta)

Call a UDF with `fused_app.run` and pass parameters from a slider.

```python
import fused_app
import streamlit as st

threshold = st.sidebar.slider("Threshold", 0, 1000, 250)
df = fused_app.run('dbd709c58f1d828bb06f3fc53991963910dc585ab45b692b5981bd78a78fa43a', threshold=threshold)

```



### HTTP endpoints

Call Fused UDFs with HTTP endpoints and pass parameters from a dropdown.

```python
import streamlit as st
import requests

city = st.selectbox("Select city", ("Boston", "Paris", "New York"))
url = f"https://staging.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_1bkKoOETvhhQ7TtKfwOQ7i/run/file?dtype_out_vector=geojson&city={city}"

response = requests.get(url)
st.write(response.content)
```

### Pandas

Create a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) `DataFrame` from a UDF HTTP endpoint.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

url = f"https://staging.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_1bkKoOETvhhQ7TtKfwOQ7i/run/file?dtype_out_vector=csv&city=Boston"
df = pd.read_csv(url)
st.data_editor(df.head())
```

### Pydeck

Create [pydeck](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layer.html) layers with UDF HTTP endpoints.

```python
import pydeck as pdk
import streamlit as st

url_overture = "https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/c8679490a7c130178e2781a45f4090208c9bcd8d8d7572532c4c39c4d0914467/run/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?dtype_out_vector=geojson&return_object=gdf_overture"
st.pydeck_chart(
    pdk.Deck(
        map_style="mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v9",
        initial_view_state=pdk.ViewState(latitude=40.7431, longitude=-73.9874, zoom=14, pitch=25),
        layers=[
            pdk.Layer(
                "TileLayer",
                data=url_overture,
                get_line_color=[255, 25, 2, 100],
                stroked=True,
                get_line_width=2,
                pickable=True,
                filled=False,
            )
        ],
    )
)
```

## Caching

It can be helpful to cache the response of UDF calls. To cache a function in Streamlit, decorate it with [`@st.cache_data`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/caching).

```python
import fused_app
import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def call_udf():
    return fused_app.run('dbd709c58f1d828bb06f3fc53991963910dc585ab45b692b5981bd78a78fa43a')

df = call_udf()
```


## Share

The menu includes options to generate a URL that can be used to share or embed (`<iframe>`) an app.

- Shared app URLs can run without authentication and include a token, such as `https://www.fused.io/workbench#app/s/i/fa_45G5QVNVUPJPo4jr6k4mtY`.
- For private sharing, URLs encode the app code within the URL string, like `https://www.fused.io/workbench#app/s/aH4sIAAAAAAAAA...`.

## GitHub gists



You can also save apps as GitHub Gists to share them with others. Apps can be loaded directly from a Gist either through the UI or by appending the Gist ID to the URL. For example:

```
https://www.fused.io/workbench#app/s/u/https://gist.github.com/pgzmnk/43045302f3b668ab5482d8a23f6f4de5
```
