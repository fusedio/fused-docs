Build and share data apps in minutes. Write Python to create [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) applications that can call UDFs to run workflows and load data.

The app builder runs code entirely in-browser thanks to [stlite](https://github.com/whitphx/stlite) and [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/). This makes apps simple and easy to share because they don't require a server, infrastructure setup, or complex dependency management. Click "Copy shareable link" on the top-right of the code editor to get a URL to share your app or `<iframe>` it.

This is ideal for Exploratory Data Analysis, to quickly iterate on UIs, make no-code tools to interact with UDFs, create interactive blog posts, or build internal tools.


Check-out [Streamlitâ€™s getting started](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started) if you are new to streamlit.


## Key features

- **No devops/infrastructure:** Run apps directly on browser.
- **Scale effortlessly:** Share with millions of users without needing to create more servers.
- **Bring maps to life:** Interact with input widgets such as [sliders](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.slider) and [dropdowns](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.selectbox) to dynamically call UDFs.
- **Run in parallel:** Trigger simultaneous UDF calls from the browser.
- **Share instantly:** Share apps behind an autogenerated URL to enhance collaboration, feedback, and time to market.

## Why Streamlit?

Since its inception in 2018, Streamlit emerged as the preferred framework to build interactive data projects with Python. The decision to adopt Streamlit for the Fused app builder is rooted in its:
- **Expressivity:** Streamlit's simple, intuitive, and elegant syntax enables developers to effortlessly create stunning applications.
- **Development experience:** The framework supports rapid prototyping and iterative development - without needing to leave the comfort of Python-land. Each time there is a user interaction, whether a code change or a widget interaction, stlite re-runs the app.
- **Shareability:** Applications run standalone on the browser without needing to stand up servers, manage access, nor manage dependencies.


## Synergy with Fused

Stlite is a Port of Streamlit to WASM. Its simplicitly comes from running on the browser. Its synergy with Fused UDFs overcomes possible limitations of browser-based execution.

- **Extensible:** Because pyodide runs on browser resources, it does not support all Python libraries, such as PyTorch or Tensorflow. Stlite can easily call Fused UDFs to run complex workflows involving any Python library.
- **Secure:** Browser-based apps are inherently exposed to public access. Stlite can lean on the secret management features of Fused UDFs to interact with sensitive data stores.
- **Blazing fast:** Stlite gives instant responsivity to apps once it loads data to the browser memory, but the browser's processing power is limited. To overcome this, stlite can load and cache data from Fused UDFs that run complex workflows - with a single line of code.

## Get started

Start writing code on the online editor then get a share URL in one click. The app code is encoded in the URL, which you can use to save, restore, and share the app.

## How to call Fused UDFs

These snippets illustrate a few ways to call Fused UDFs from Streamlit apps.

### With `fused_app.run` (beta)

```python
import fused_app
import streamlit as st

threshold = st.sidebar.slider("Threshold", 0, 1000, 250)
token = "dbd709c58f1d828bb06f3fc53991963910dc585ab45b692b5981bd78a78fa43a"
df = fused_app.run(token, threshold=threshold)

```

### HTTP endpoints
```python
import fused_app
import streamlit as st
import requests
import pandas as pd

city = st.selectbox("Select city", ("Boston", "Paris", "New York"))
st.write("You selected:", city)

# Define the URL that returns geojson
url = f"https://staging.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_1bkKoOETvhhQ7TtKfwOQ7i/run/file?dtype_out_vector=geojson&city={city}"

# Send a GET request
response = requests.get(url)

# Handle the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Print the response content if the request was successful
    st.write("Response Content:")
    st.write(response.content)
else:
    st.write(f"Failed to retrieve data. Status code: {response.status_code}")

```

### Pandas
```python
import streamlit as st
import requests
import pandas as pd

city = st.selectbox("Select city", ("Boston", "Paris", "New York"))
st.write("You selected:", city)

# Define the URL that returns csv
url = f"https://staging.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_1bkKoOETvhhQ7TtKfwOQ7i/run/file?dtype_out_vector=csv&city={city}"

# Read csv with pandas
df = pd.read_csv(url)
st.data_editor(df.head())

```

### Pydeck calling Tile HTTP endpoints

```python
import pydeck as pdk
import streamlit as st


url_overture = "https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/c8679490a7c130178e2781a45f4090208c9bcd8d8d7572532c4c39c4d0914467/run/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?dtype_out_vector=geojson&return_object=gdf_overture"


st.pydeck_chart(
    pdk.Deck(
        map_style="mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v9",
        initial_view_state=pdk.ViewState(
            latitude=40.7431,
            longitude=-73.9874,
            zoom=14,
            pitch=25,
        ),
        tooltip={
            "html": "<b>Structure Value:</b> ${val_struct}",
            "style": {"backgroundColor": "steelblue", "color": "white"},
        },
        layers=[
            pdk.Layer(
                "TileLayer",
                data=url_overture,
                get_line_color=[255, 25, 2, 100],
                stroked=True,
                get_line_width=2,
                pickable=True,
                filled=False,
            )
        ],
    )
)

```
