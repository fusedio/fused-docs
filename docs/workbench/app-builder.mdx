# App Builder [BETA]

The App Builder is an IDE to transform [User Defined Functions (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/) into interactive, shareable apps.

Data scientists often need to make analytics interactive and accessible to broader audiences. However, building traditional React apps with maps and widgets can be impractical, especially considering prototypes might be discarded. Additionally, frontend frameworks are not well-suited for transforming data or handling large datasets.


With this in mind, the App Builder enables users to build and run apps with [serverless Streamlit](https://github.com/whitphx/stlite), an open source framework to deliver dynamic data apps with just a few lines of Python. These are some of its capabilities to keep in mind:

## Build apps

You build apps by writing Python in the code editor, shown below. As you write code you'll notice the app automatically reruns as code and widgets change (configurable in the settings).

You may add [input widgets](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/widgets) that interact with UDFs, display data with [data](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data) and [text](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/text) elements, and structure the app with [layout components](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/layout).

import Iframe from "@site/src/components/Iframe";
import CODE from "@site/src/app-iframe/python/basic.py";

<Iframe
  id="iframe-1"
  code={CODE}
  requirements={[
    "/pyarrow/pyarrow-17.0.0-cp312-cp312-pyodide_2024_0_wasm32.whl",
    "micropip",
    "pyodide-unix-timezones", // needed by pyarrow
    "requests",
    "yarl",
    "pydeck",
  ]}
  height="400px"

\
Try running the code snippets below to acquaint yourself with the App Builder.


```python showLineNumbers
import streamlit as st

st.write("Hello, *Fused!* :rocket:")
```






## Dependencies

Click "Requirements" on the top-right menu of the code editor to set Python packages for the app. Only packages compatible with [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) are supported. Please get in touch if you need help with a specific package.


You may also choose to install dependencies at runtime to reduce start-up time. Use [micropip](https://pypi.org/project/micropip/) to install packages at runtime. This is also useful when sharing apps from [GitHub Gists](/workbench/app-builder/#github-gists), which cannot specify dependencies ahead of execution.


```python showLineNumbers
import micropip
await micropip.install("pydeck")
import pydeck as pdk
```


## Troubleshoot

Click "Reset app" on the top-right menu of the code editor in case things aren't working as expected.


## Write UDFs

You may define UDFs in the App Builder's code editor and invoke them with [`fused.run`](/workbench/app-builder/#with-fusedrun-beta). This snippet creates a UDF that returns a `DataFrame` with a column of zeros with a length determined by a slider widget.

```python showLineNumbers
import fused
import streamlit as st

count = st.slider("Count", 1, 10, 4)

@fused.udf
def udf(count: int = 1):
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.DataFrame({'values': [0] * count})

df = fused.run(udf, count=count)
st.write(df)
```

You may also run the UDF on a remote worker by setting `engine='realtime'` in the `fused.run` call.

```python showLineNumbers
df = fused.run(udf, count=count, engine='realtime')
```

## Call UDFs

Apps may call UDFs and load their output into memory. This enables them to run resource-intensive operations and use libraries unsupported by Pyodide. These snippets illustrate a few ways to call UDFs.

### With `fused_app.run` (beta)

Call a UDF by its shared token with `fused_app.run` and pass parameters from a [slider](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.slider).

```python showLineNumbers
import fused_app
import streamlit as st

threshold = st.sidebar.slider("Threshold", 0, 1000, 250)
df = fused_app.run('fsh_1uQkWaPFfB2O7Qy1zzOHS9', threshold=threshold)
```



### HTTP endpoints

Call UDF [HTTP endpoints](/core-concepts/run/#http-requests) with the [requests library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and pass parameters from a [dropdown selectbox](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.selectbox).

```python showLineNumbers
import streamlit as st
import requests

city = st.selectbox("Select city", ("Boston", "Paris", "New York"))
url = f"https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_2wEv0k8Xu2grl4vTVRlGVk/run/file?dtype_out_vector=geojson&city={city}"
response = requests.get(url)
st.json(response.json())
```

Render the raster response of UDFs as images.

```python showLineNumbers
import streamlit as st

st.image('https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_7Yuq2R1Ru1x5hgEEfNDF5t/run/tiles/11/583/787?dtype_out_raster=png')
```

### Pydeck

Create a [pydeck](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layer.html) `TileLayer` that calls a UDF HTTP endpoint.

```python showLineNumbers
import pydeck as pdk
import streamlit as st

url_overture = "https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/c8679490a7c130178e2781a45f4090208c9bcd8d8d7572532c4c39c4d0914467/run/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?dtype_out_vector=geojson&return_object=gdf_overture"
st.pydeck_chart(
    pdk.Deck(
        map_style="mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v9",
        initial_view_state=pdk.ViewState(latitude=40.7431, longitude=-73.9874, zoom=14, pitch=25),
        layers=[
            pdk.Layer(
                "TileLayer",
                data=url_overture,
                get_line_color=[255, 25, 2, 100],
                stroked=True,
                get_line_width=2,
                pickable=True,
                filled=False,
            )
        ],
    )
)
```

### Folium

Create a [streamlit-folium](https://folium.streamlit.app/) `TileLayer` that calls a UDF HTTP endpoint.

```python showLineNumbers
import folium
from streamlit_folium import st_folium

m = folium.Map(location=[22.5, -115], zoom_start=4)
url_raster = 'https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_3QYQiMYzgyV18rUBdrOEpO/run/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?dtype_out_raster=png'
folium.raster_layers.TileLayer(tiles=url_raster, attr='fu', interactive=True,).add_to(m)
st_folium(m)
```

## Caching

It can be helpful to cache the response of UDF calls. To cache a function in Streamlit, decorate it with [`@st.cache_data`](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/caching).

```python showLineNumbers
import fused
import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def cached_output():
    return fused.run('fsh_1uQkWaPFfB2O7Qy1zzOHS9')

df = cached_output()
```


## Share

The App Builder menu includes options to generate a URL to share the app or or embed it with an `<iframe>`.

import ImgShare from '@site/static/img/shareable_links.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImgShare} alt="File" style={{}} />
</div>

- **Shareable links** can run without authentication and include a token, such as `https://www.fused.io/workbench#app/s/i/fa_45G5QVNVUPJPo4jr6k4mtY`.
- **Private links** serialize the app's code within the URL string and don't get saved to the database, such as `https://www.fused.io/workbench#app/s/aH4sIAAAAAAAAA...`.

## GitHub gists



Apps can be saved as GitHub Gists. They can be loaded from a Gist through the UI or by appending the Gist ID to the following URL.

```
https://www.fused.io/workbench#app/s/u/https://gist.github.com/pgzmnk/43045302f3b668ab5482d8a23f6f4de5
```
