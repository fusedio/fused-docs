Prototype and share scalable data-driven apps in minutes. The Fused app builder combines Fused UDFs with a slick frontend experience - all in Python. 

The app builder runs stlite and Pyodide entirely in-browser. Stlite apps are excellent for sharing because they run entirely in the browser. Just click "Copy shareable link" on the top-right to get a shareable URL which you can share with the world and even embed in other webpages with an `<iframe>`. They are well suited to quickly experiment with parametrized UDFs, do lightweight data analysis, create interactive blog posts, and even build internal tools. 



## Key features

This architecture empowers teams to harness powerful features such as:
- Effortless scaling: Share with millions of users without infra setup or costs.
- Bring maps to life: Use Streamlit input widgets such as sliders and dropdowns to call UDF dynamically.
- Focus on the app: Run apps directly in the browser without a dedicated server. 
- Run in parallel: Trigger simultaneous UDF calls from the client.
- Share instantly: Share effortlessly by a URL to enhance collaboration, feedback, and time to market.

## Why Streamlit?

Since its inception in 2018, Streamlit emerged as the preferred framework to build interactive data projects with Python. The decision to adopt Streamlit for the Fused app builder is rooted in its:
- Expressivity: Streamlit’s simple, intuitive, and elegant syntax enables developers to effortlessly create stunning applications.
- Development experience: The framework supports rapid prototyping and iterative development - without needing to leave the comfort of Python-land. Each time there is a user interaction, whether a code change or a widget interaction, stlite re-runs the app. 
- Shareability: Applications run standalone on the browser without needing to stand up servers, manage access, nor install dependencies locally. 

This approach provides users with the benefit of Streamlit without the complexities of managing a server. 


## Synergy with Fused

Stlite is simple and speedy because it runs on the browser. Its synergy with Fused UDFs overcomes the limitations of browser-based execution.

- Extensible: Stlite is a Port of the Streamlit library to WASM, which combines with Pyodide to run Python natively on the browser. Because it runs on browser resources, it does not support all Python libraries that folks might reach for, such as PyTorch or Tensorflow.  Stlite can easily call Fused UDFs to run complex workflows involving any Python library.
- Secure: Because stlite applications reside in the web-browser, it’s inherently exposed to public access. Stlite can lean on the secret management features of Fused UDFs to interact with data stores.
- Blazing fast: Stlite gives instant responsivity to apps once it loads data to the browser memory, but the browser’s processing power is limited. To overcome this, stlite can - with a single line of code -  load and cache data from Fused UDF, which can run complex chained and parallel workflows. 

## Get started

You can start writing code on the online editor then automagically turn it into a shareable web app in one click. The app code is encoded in the URL, which you can use to seamlessly save, restore, and share the app. 

## Call Fused UDFs 

### With `fused_app.run` (beta)

```python
import fused_app
import streamlit as st

threshold = st.sidebar.slider("Threshold", 0, 1000, 250)
token = "dbd709c58f1d828bb06f3fc53991963910dc585ab45b692b5981bd78a78fa43a"
df = fused_app.run(token, threshold=threshold)

```

### HTTP endpoints
```python
import fused_app
import streamlit as st
import requests
import pandas as pd

city = st.selectbox("Select city", ("Boston", "Paris", "New York"))
st.write("You selected:", city)

# Define the URL that returns geojson
url = f"https://staging.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_1bkKoOETvhhQ7TtKfwOQ7i/run/file?dtype_out_vector=geojson&city={city}"

# Send a GET request
response = requests.get(url)

# Handle the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Print the response content if the request was successful
    st.write("Response Content:")
    st.write(response.content)
else:
    st.write(f"Failed to retrieve data. Status code: {response.status_code}")

```

### Pandas
```python
import streamlit as st
import requests
import pandas as pd

city = st.selectbox("Select city", ("Boston", "Paris", "New York"))
st.write("You selected:", city)

# Define the URL that returns csv
url = f"https://staging.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/fsh_1bkKoOETvhhQ7TtKfwOQ7i/run/file?dtype_out_vector=csv&city={city}"

# Read csv with pandas
df = pd.read_csv(url)
st.data_editor(df.head())

```

### Pydeck calling Tile HTTP endpoints 

```python
import pydeck as pdk
import streamlit as st


url_overture = "https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/c8679490a7c130178e2781a45f4090208c9bcd8d8d7572532c4c39c4d0914467/run/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?dtype_out_vector=geojson&return_object=gdf_overture"


st.pydeck_chart(
    pdk.Deck(
        map_style="mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v9",
        initial_view_state=pdk.ViewState(
            latitude=40.7431,
            longitude=-73.9874,
            zoom=14,
            pitch=25,
        ),
        tooltip={
            "html": "<b>Structure Value:</b> ${val_struct}",
            "style": {"backgroundColor": "steelblue", "color": "white"},
        },
        layers=[
            pdk.Layer(
                "TileLayer",
                data=url_overture,
                get_line_color=[255, 25, 2, 100],
                stroked=True,
                get_line_width=2,
                pickable=True,
                filled=False,
            )
        ],
    )
)

```
