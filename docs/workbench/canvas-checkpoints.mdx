Canvas Checkpoints let you capture a moment in time of your Canvas.

Create a checkpoint to save the current state of your Canvas, including all UDFs, connections, and changes, so you can return to it.

If you experiment, remove a UDF, or make larger updates, you can restore a previous checkpoint and continue working from that saved state.
