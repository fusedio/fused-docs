## Kernel

Selecting a kernel in Workbench sets the environment for your session, providing access to Python libraries at runtime.

## Secrets management

Store and manage secrets that are securely encrypted in the backend.

Add and edit snippets, and copy snippets to access them. Use the following syntax to retrieve a snippet from your UDF:

```python showLineNumbers
import fused
fused.secrets["my_secret"]
```

You can also list all available secrets with:

```python showLineNumbers
dir(fused.secrets)
```


## Environment variables
Environment variables in Fused are pre-configured by the Fused team. These variables can be accessed in the usual way through Python's os module:

```python showLineNumbers
import os
os.environ["ENV_VAR_NAME"]
```
