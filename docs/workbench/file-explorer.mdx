The File Explorer provides a streamlined interface to browse, preview, and open files stored in S3.

Data practitioners looking to quickly explore datasets waste time moving data and writing boilerplate code just to access files. The File Explorer simplifies this process by allowing you to easily browse any S3 bucket, preview data without writing code, and quickly create UDFs in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) with templates for specific file types.


- [Browse](/workbench/file-explorer/#browse) S3 buckets
- Quickly [preview](/workbench/file-explorer/#open-as-udf) files
- [Open](/workbench/file-explorer/#open-as-udf) as UDF for custom [file types](/workbench/file-explorer/#file-types)



## Browse

Browse directories and files of S3 buckets. Use the search bar and filter options to quickly locate specific files. To explore your own bucket, simply paste its S3 path. Get in touch to connect private buckets.

## Preview

The Explorer displays a bucket's contents with collapsible directories. Each file shows metadata such as file size and path, along with utilities to download, delete, copy its path directly or as a signed URL, and [open it as a UDF](/workbench/file-explorer/#open-as-udf).

Click on a file to preview its content. If the file has a spatial component, it will be displayed on the map, allowing you to zoom and pan to explore the data. For images or other file types, Fused will make a best effort to render and display the content.

## Open as UDF


Create Fused UDFs using templates for common file types. Double-click on a file to generate a new UDF that reads it with the default template, or use the file's menu to access additional options. You can also open [Parquet tables](https://www.upsolver.com/blog/apache-parquet-why-use) by clicking "Open Table."

## File types

Template UDFs are available for common file types (like `CSV`, `Parquet`) and tools (like `DuckDB` and `GeoPandas`). See the latest template UDFs in the [UDFs repo](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/files).

Supported file types for for vector tables include `parquet`, `JSON`, `CSV`, `excel`, `zip`, and `KML`. For raster files `GeoTIFF` and `NetCDF` are supported. If you need a file type that isn't supported, request it on the Fused [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/BxS5wMzdRk) or share your own template with the community.
