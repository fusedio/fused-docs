The File Explorer provides a streamlined interface to browse, preview, and open files stored in S3. Data practitioners looking to quickly explore datasets find themselves spending time on the repeated task of moving data and writing boilerplate code to access files. The File Explorer makes it easy to navigate any S3 bucket, preview data without writing code, and create custom UDFs in the Builder using templates for specific file types.


- [Browse](/workbench/file-explorer/#browse) S3 buckets
- Quickly [preview](/workbench/file-explorer/#open-as-udf) files
- [Open](/workbench/file-explorer/#open-as-udf) as UDF for custom [file types](/workbench/file-explorer/#file-types)



## Browse

Browse directories and files of S3 buckets. Use the search bar and filter options to find specific files quickly. Paste an S3 path to a publicly accessible bucket to explore your own bucket.

## Open as UDF

Create Fused UDFs from templates for common file types in one click. Template UDFs are available for common file types (like `CSV`, `Parquet`) and tools (like `DuckDB` and `GeoPandas`). The [UDFs repo](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/files) contains template UDFs for the various file types.


Double-click on a file to open a new UDF that reads it with the default template, or click the file's menu to view other options. Click "Open Table" to open entire the [Parquet tables](https://www.upsolver.com/blog/apache-parquet-why-use).

## File types

Currently supported file types for vector tables are parquet, JSON, CSV, excel, zip, and KML. For raster files GeoTIFF and NetCDF. If there's a file type you'd like to see supported?Please create and share it with the community, or let us know so we can add a templates.
