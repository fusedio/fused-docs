The File Explorer provides a streamlined interface to browse, preview, and open files in cloud object storage and the [mounted disk](/core-concepts/content-management/file-system/#mntcache-disk). Fused supports Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage, with more integrations coming soon.

When working with data, it can be time-consuming to track down datasets, request access, download gigabytes of data, and write boilerplate code to read files. The File Explorer simplifies this process by enabling users to easily browse any object storage bucket, visualize file contents without writing code, and quickly create [User Defined Functions (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/) in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) with [templates](/workbench/file-explorer/#template-udfs) for specific file types.

- [Browse](/workbench/file-explorer/#browse) object storage buckets and list their files
- Quickly [preview](/workbench/file-explorer/#preview) files
- [Create](/workbench/file-explorer/#create-udf) a new UDF from a [template](/workbench/file-explorer/#template-udfs) to open the file
- [Connect](/workbench/file-explorer/#connect-your-own-bucket) an S3 or GCS bucket

## Browse

Browse directories and files in buckets. Use the search bar and filter options to quickly locate specific files, and "Favorite" files for quick access. To explore a bucket, find it in the "Favorites" dropdown or paste its path. To connect private buckets, contact Fused.

  <img src={FEsearch} alt="File" style={{ width: '80%' }} />
</div>

## Preview

The Explorer displays a bucket's directories and objects as folders. Each listed file shows metadata such as file size and path, along with utilities to download or delete the file, copy its path, generate a [signed URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html), and [create a UDF](/workbench/file-explorer/#create-udf) to open it.

Click on a file to preview its content. If the file has a spatial component, it will be displayed on the [map](/workbench/udf-builder/map), allowing you to zoom and pan to explore the rendered data. For images or other file types, Fused will make a best-effort to render and display the content.

  <img src={FEpreview} alt="File" style={{ width: '80%' }} />
</div>

## Create UDF

Create Fused UDFs using templates for common file types. Double-click on a file to create a new templated UDF that reads the file, or find additional readers in the file's kebab menu. [Parquet tables](https://www.upsolver.com/blog/apache-parquet-why-use) show an "Open Table" button to open them at the directory level.

import FEcreateudf from '/img/workbench/file-explorer/file_explorer_createudf.png';

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src={FEcreateudf} alt="File" style={{ width: '80%' }} />
</div>

## Template UDFs

Template UDFs are available for common file types (like `CSV`, `Parquet`) and tools (like `DuckDB` and `GeoPandas`). See the latest template UDFs in the [UDFs repo](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/files).

Supported file types for vector tables include `parquet`, `JSON`, `CSV`, `excel`, `zip`, and `KML`. For raster files `GeoTIFF` and `NetCDF` are supported. If you need a file type that isn't supported, request it on the Fused [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/BxS5wMzdRk) or [contribute](/workbench/udf-catalog/#contribute-to-fused) a template to the community.

## Connect your own bucket

<Tag color="#3399ff">Enterprise</Tag> _This feature is accessible to organizations with a Fused Enterprise subscription._

### Amazon S3

import Tag from '@site/src/components/Tag'

Contact Fused to connect your S3 bucket to the File Explorer. Set the policy below on your bucket, replacing `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` with its name. Fused will provide `YOUR_ENV_NAME`.

import Details from '@theme/MDXComponents/Details';

<Details open={false}>


```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Allow object access by Fused fused account",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::926411091187:role/rt-production-YOUR_ENV_NAME",
                    "arn:aws:iam::926411091187:role/ec2_job_task_role-v2-production-YOUR_ENV_NAME",
                    "arn:aws:iam::926411091187:role/fused_server_role_prod_us_west_2"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObjectAttributes",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

</Details>

Alternatively, use this [Fused app](https://www.fused.io/workbench#app/s/i/fa_2yQFVcbSYR1vW4Aa8zL1HC) to automatically structure the policy for you.

The bucket must enable the following CORS settings to allow uploading files from Fused.

```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "range",
            "content-type",
            "content-length"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET",
            "HEAD",
            "PUT",
            "POST"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [
            "content-range"
        ],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 0
    }
]
```

### Google Cloud Storage [Beta]

Coming soon.

{/*
To connect a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket to your Fused environment, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Create a Service Account in GCS
Set up a Google Cloud service account with the necessary permissions for accessing your GCS bucket. See the Google Cloud documentation for service accounts:
- [Create a Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create)
- [Manage Access for Service Accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-service-accounts)

2. Download the JSON Key File
After creating the service account, download the JSON key file associated with it. This file contains credentials that Fused will use to access your GCS bucket.

3. Set the JSON Key as a Secret
Set the JSON key as a secret in the [secrets management UI](/workbench/account/#secrets-management). Name the secret `gcs_fused`.

Once configured, you'll be able to interact with your GCS bucket from within Fused. */}
