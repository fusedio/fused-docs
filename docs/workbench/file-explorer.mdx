The File Explorer provides a streamlined interface to browse, preview, and open files in cloud object storage, like S3.


When working with data, it can be time consuming to track down datasets, request access, download gigabytes of data, and write boilerplate code to read files. The File Explorer simplifies this process by enabling users to easily browse any object storage bucket, visualize file contents without writing code, and quickly create [User Defined Function (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/) in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) with [templates](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/files) for specific file types.


- [Browse](/workbench/file-explorer/#browse) object storage buckets and list their files
- Quickly [preview](/workbench/file-explorer/#preview) files
- [Create](/workbench/file-explorer/#create-udf) a new UDF from a [template UDFs](/workbench/file-explorer/#template-udfs) to open the file

## Browse

Browse directories and files in buckets. Use the search bar and filter options to quickly locate specific files. To explore a bucket, find it in the "Favorites" dropdown or paste its path. Get in touch to connect private buckets. Be sure to "Favorite" frequently accessed files for quick access.

## Preview

The Explorer displays a bucket's directories and objects as collapsible folders. Each listed file shows metadata such as file size and path, along with utilities to download or delete the file, copy its path, generate a [signed URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html), and [create a UDF](/workbench/file-explorer/#create-udf) to open it.

Click on a file to preview its content. If the file has a spatial component, it will be displayed on the [map](/workbench/udf-builder/map), allowing you to zoom and pan to explore the rendered data. For images or other file types, Fused will make a best effort to render and display the content.

## Create UDF


Create Fused UDFs using templates for common file types. Double-click on a file to create a new templated UDF that reads the file, or find additional readers the file's kebab menu. [Parquet tables](https://www.upsolver.com/blog/apache-parquet-why-use) show an "Open Table" button to open them at the directory level.

## Template UDFs

Template UDFs are available for common file types (like `CSV`, `Parquet`) and tools (like `DuckDB` and `GeoPandas`). See the latest template UDFs in the [UDFs repo](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/files).

Supported file types for for vector tables include `parquet`, `JSON`, `CSV`, `excel`, `zip`, and `KML`. For raster files `GeoTIFF` and `NetCDF` are supported. If you need a file type that isn't supported, request it on the Fused [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/BxS5wMzdRk) or [contribute](/python-sdk/contribute/) your own template to the community.
