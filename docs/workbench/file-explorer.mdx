The Fused File Explorer enhances how you browse and manage files in S3 buckets. Use it to quickly list file contents, preview them on a map, and open them as Fused UDFs.

Just paste an S3 path to a publicly accessible bucket, and start exploring your data! It's well suited for quick data exploration and to get a jumpstart on your analysis. 


## Key features

The File explorer addresses common challenges associated with managing files in S3 buckets. Here are some key features:

- Browse S3 Buckets: Easily navigate through your S3 bucket to locate and manage files.
- Preview Content: Quickly preview the contents of your files on a map, enabling quick data exploration without downloading the files.
- Rapid Access: Double-click or use the context menu to create custom UDFs for specific file types. 
- Flexible file types: File type templates handle a wide range of file formats (audio, rasters, tables, and beyond) so you don't have to re-write custom openers.

## Core functionality

### Browse

Browse through directories and files of S3 buckets linked to your account. Use the search bar and filter options to find specific files quickly.

</div>


### Preview

The Fused File Explorer allows you to preview the contents of your files on a map. Simply click on a file to display its content, and use the map controls to zoom, pan, and explore the data.

Note: The preview feature is currently available for Parquet files only.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImgFe1} alt="File" style={{width: 600}} />
</div>

### Open as Fused UDF

Open Parquet tables and individual files directly as Fused UDFs. 

import ImgFee from '@site/static/img/image-fe.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImgFee} alt="File" style={{width: 600}} />
</div>

Simply click the "Open Table" button, double click on a file, or find template options in the file's menu. The file will be opened as a UDF. 

import ImgFe3 from '@site/static/img/image-fe-3.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImgFe3} alt="File" style={{width: 200}} />
</div>
