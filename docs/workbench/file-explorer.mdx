## Key features

The File explorer addresses common challenges associated with managing files in S3 buckets.

- **Browse S3 Buckets:** Easily navigate S3 buckets across organizations in a centralized UI.
- **Quick preview:** Explore data without writing code or downloading files.
- **Rapid Access:** Create custom UDFs for specific file types.
- **Flexible file types:** File type templates handle a wide range of file formats (audio, rasters, tables, and beyond) so you don't have to re-write custom openers.

## Browse

Browse directories and files of S3 buckets. Use the search bar and filter options to find specific files quickly. Paste an S3 path to a publicly accessible bucket to explore your own bucket.

## Open as UDF

Create Fused UDFs from templates for common file types in one click. Template UDFs are available for common file types (like `CSV`, `Parquet`) and tools (like `DuckDB` and `GeoPandas`). The [UDFs repo](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/files) contains template UDFs for the various file types.


Double-click on a file to open a new UDF that reads it with the default template, or click the file's menu to view other options. Click "Open Table" to open entire the [Parquet tables](https://www.upsolver.com/blog/apache-parquet-why-use).
