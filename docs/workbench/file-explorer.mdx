# File explorer



The Fused File Explorer enhances how you browse and manage files in S3 buckets. Use it to quickly list file contents, preview them on a map, and open them as Fused UDFs.

Just paste an S3 path to a publicly accessible bucket, and start exploring your data! It's well suited for quick data exploration and to get a jumpstart on your analysis. 


## Key features

The File explorer addresses common challenges associated with managing files in S3 buckets. Here are some key features:

- Browse S3 Buckets: Easily navigate through your S3 bucket to locate and manage files.
- Preview Content: Quickly preview the contents of your files on a map, enabling quick data exploration without downloading the files.
- Rapid Access: Double-click or use the context menu to create custom UDFs for specific file types. 
- Flexible file types: File type templates handle a wide range of file formats (audio, rasters, tables, and beyond) so you don't have to re-write custom openers.
