Workbench is a browser-based platform to build with data. It offers developers easy access to data and instant feedback as they open files, write code to transform data, and build apps.

Fused revolves around [User Defined Functions (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/) - Python functions that can be invoked remotely and used to read files, process data, and power data apps. In Workbench, users browse datasets in the [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/) and open them as UDFs, convert them into analytics scripts in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/), share them in the [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog), and finally turn them into shareable apps with the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/).

## Troubleshoot authentication issues

### 1. Try to run a UDF

To verify if your account is active, navigate to the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) then [create](/workbench/udf-catalog/#new-udf) and run a User Defined Function (UDF). If your account is configured correctly, the map should show "Changes pending" and begin to render the UDF output.

If you see the following error message it's possible your email is not associated with an execution environment yet.

```text
Access is not configured for you in the Fused Workbench.

Please refresh the page if you think this is an error,
or get in touch if you require further help.

Cause: Realtime instance not configured.
```

import ImgUdf from '@site/static/img/login_udf.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImgUdf} alt="File" style={{width: 600}} />
</div>


### 2. Check User Preferences

Visit your account's settings page. Verify that the correct email address is displayed, and check if the account is registered. Also, ensure that both the environment and realtime environment are properly configured, indicated by checkmarks. If X marks are displayed, contact the Fused team for further assistance.

import Imgprofile from '@site/static/img/login_profile.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={Imgprofile} alt="File" style={{width: 600}} />
</div>

### 3. Contact the Fused team for further assistance

If the issue persists, reach out to the Fused team for further assistance. Provide them with screenshots of error messages to help them diagnose the problem.
