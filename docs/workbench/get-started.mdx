Workbench is a browser-based platform to build with data. It offers developers easy access to data and instant feedback as they open files, write code to transform data, and build apps.

Fused revolves around [User Defined Functions (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/) - Python functions that can be invoked remotely and used to read files, process data, and power apps. In Workbench, users browse datasets in the [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/) and open them as UDFs, convert them into analytics scripts in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/), share them in the [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog), and finally turn them into shareable apps with the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/).

## Troubleshoot authentication issues

### 1. Try to run a UDF

To verify if your account is active, navigate to the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) then [create](/workbench/udf-catalog/#new-udf) and run a User Defined Function (UDF). If your account is configured correctly, the map should show "Changes pending" and begin to render the UDF output. If you see the following error message, the email you used to sign in may not be associated with an active execution environment.

```text
Access is not configured for you in the Fused Workbench.

Please refresh the page if you think this is an error,
or get in touch if you require further help.

Cause: Realtime instance not configured.
```

import ImgUdf from '@site/static/img/login_udf.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImgUdf} alt="File" style={{width: 600}} />
</div>


### 2. Check User Preferences

Go to your account settings and confirm your preferences, especially if you're getting any errors about your execution environment.

import Imgprofile from '@site/static/img/login_profile.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={Imgprofile} alt="File" style={{width: 600}} />
</div>
