The map builder is styled like the familiar IDE format - so developers feel right at home. Just like an IDE, the main interface is the code editor. However, Workbench takes it to the next level by deeply integrating the code editor to the adjacent [deck.gl](http://deck.gl) map and expanding their joint capabilities in significant ways.

On the Workbench, developers rapidly iterate on UDFs and instantly see the effect of their code on the map. The immediacy is a result of strategic data partitioning and caching, which enables Fused to interactively load, process, and view any size datasets.
