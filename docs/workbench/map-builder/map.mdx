As developers iterate on UDFs and conduct exploratory data analysis, the interactive Deck.gl map gives them immediate feedback of the effect the code has on the data. This powerful feature reduces iteration time and increases productivity. As a developer zooms and moves the map between points of interest, Fused automatically runs the UDF code on the tiles shown in the viewport.

This means that a data scientist can instantly visualize the output of a complex geospatial operations - then run at any scale without engineering heavy-lifting.

As an example, this image shows the output of a UDF that calculates the shortest path from census block groups to nearby hospitals, colored by travel distance. Loading the original census data is slow, and route planning operations are cumbersome on distributed compute systems, but Fused's caching and parallelization immediately gets the data to the screen, so analysts can ask deeper questions on the spot.

:::info
UDF outputs with a spatial component can be rendered on the map. In this case Fused expects the CRS of spatial outputs to be `EPSG:4326` - `WGS84` and will otherwise attempt to convert it.

### Toolbar

As developers interact with the map to inspect the UDF's results, they will find powerful utilities along the edges of the viewport. On the top left, they can click a toggle button to pause or resume the execution of the UDF code. Hitting pause on execution is useful to extensively edit a UDF or to glance at adjacent areas without rendering the layer for them.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: The viewport tilts and rotates via `CMD` + Click, then drag.

## Sidebar

The sidebar on the top-right of the map also furnishes powerful utilities. These include a geocoder to direct the viewport to searched locations, a selector to change the basemap, a button to capture screenshots of the viewport, and toggles to enable a tooltip and fullscreen mode.

## Debugger

As you write a UDF in Workbench, you might want information about the data that renders - or fails to render - in a particular area of the viewport.

Whether you are looking to determine the attributes of a specific rendered pixel or determine why no data is showing, you can inspect the map with the interactive debugger.

To enable it, simply click on the area of the map you want to inspect. To tuck it away, click "Clear debug selection" in the bottom right-hand menu, or select another UDF.

If data renders successfully, the attribute values and coordinates of the selected point will appear in the "Selected Object" tab in the Results pane.

Otherwise, if there's an error, the error code and associated information will appear.




## Geospatial data

Workbench by default renders `gpd.GeoDataFrame`,  `gpd.GeoSeries`, and `shapely geometry` on the map.

Fused also renders on the map array (raster) objects with spatial metadata, like `xarray.DataArray`. Arrays without spatial metadata, like `numpy.ndarray`, can be can have their spatial extent specified with a geometry object or an array bounds as `[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]`. If the bounds are not present, they default to `(-180, -90, 180, 90)`. For example: 

```python
return np.array([[â€¦], [â€¦]]), [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]
```
