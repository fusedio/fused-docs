## UDF Catalog

Clicking the "Add UDF" button on the navbar opens the UDF Catalog.

The Explorer is the one-stop-shop to browse personal and public UDFs, upload UDF zip files, and create new UDFs.

## UDF List

Users can create, delete, reorder, show/hide, and save layers on the UDF list.

Clicking a layer will make it the “active” layer and bring up its associated code in the right-hand editor. From there, clicking on the “visualization” tab will bring up the editor to style the layer.

If a UDF renders an output specific to a location, or has "default view state" enabled, clicking the "zoom to layer" icon will quickly pan the viewport to the area of interest. This is useful when switching between UDFs and to get context when opening a UDF a colleague shared.

## Preferences

The gear icon on the navbar contains global preferences. These toggle show/hide workbench sections, set the runtime environment, set the app's color theme, and show the user available keyboard shortcuts.

### Save the Workbench session state [EXPERIMENTAL]

While debugging, it might be useful to download or restore the Workbench's configuration. To this end, the Workbench session's state can be downloaded as a JSON file. When the file is uploaded to a Fused Workbench, the app will reinstate the session.
