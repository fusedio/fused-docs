## Code Editor

The UDF Editor is where developers author UDFs. They can write Python to explore and analyze geospatial data of any size interactively.

### Auto, Tile, and File

A UDF can be set to render its outputs on Workbench as a [Tile or File](/basics/core-concepts/#file--tile) - or autodetect between the two based on parameters. The choice depends on the nature of data the UDF will return. New UDFs are set to autodetect by default, and the kind can be changed in the top-right dropdown of the code editor.

☝️ Read more about File & Tile in the [core concepts section](/basics/core-concepts/#udf-execution-modes-file-tile).

:::note
Because the same UDF endpoint can called as either File or Tile, it needs to tell Workbench which one to use. When a UDF is configured as "Auto", Workbench automatically handles the output as Tile if it statically checks that the types `fused.types.TileXYZ`, `fused.types.TileGDF`, or `fused.types.Bbox` are used in the UDF. Otherwise, it assumes File.

Note that the "Auto" setting is specific and applicable only to the Workbench UI. UDFs called via `fused-py` or HTTP requests run as Tile only if a parameter specifies the Tile geometry.

### Toolbar

The toolbar atop the editor is where buttons to configure, save, duplicate, download, and delete UDFs are located. Clicking “Download” saves the present state of the UDF code and module locally as a `.zip` file that can be loaded with the Python SDK or shared with others so they can import into their workbench.

### Error indicator

Sifting through error logs to debug failed multi-hour jobs is a persistent and recurring annoyance of working with large datasets and data orchestrators. The Fused Workbench is desiged with sound developer experience in mind. As such, the UDF code editor immediately highlights errors in the code, so developers can flow and focus on what matters.

## Module

As UDFs grow in complexity, it's useful to modularize the code to make it reusable and composable. It's also a good practice to keep only the essential "business logic" in the decorated UDF function - this makes it easy to know what a UDF does at a glance.

With this in mind, a Fused UDF can optionally import Python objects from its acompanying module, with an import statement as if importing from a Python package. In the Workbench, the "module" code editor tab is the place for helper functions and other associated Python objects for the UDF to import. Keep in mind that the module's name is configurable in order to avoid naming collisions.

In this example, UDF imports the function `arr_to_plasma` from its module, which is named `utils`. The function contains support logic the UDF uses it to transform an array.

# Utility modules

To efficiently manage common tasks such as loading credentials, authenticating to external services, and executing routine queries, it’s best to organize these functions into a separate utility module that can be reused across multiple UDFs. You can achieve this by creating a dedicated module with with helper function, then referencing this module in each UDF. Store this module in a GitHub repository, and use `fused.load` to import it into your UDFs. 

This approach enables you to maintain a version controlled source of truth for utility functions and ensure consistent and easy access across different UDFs. This streamlines development and enhances code readability & maintainability.

UDFs can import from a variety of sources: from the local context and from GitHub. 

### "Module" tab


Local modules are Python files in the same environment as the UDF.

In the Workbench, use the "module" code editor tab to store helper functions and other related Python objects that your UDFs can import. You can configure the module’s name to prevent naming collisions. In this example, the UDF imports the function `arr_to_plasma` from its module, which is named `utils`.

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(bbox):
    from utils import arr_to_plasma

    return arr_to_plasma(arr.values, min_max=(0, .8))
```

![Alt text](https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/docs_assets/image-33.png)

When importing a module from a Python environment outside of Workbench, specify the module as a locally-scoped file name in the `headers` argument of the `@fused.udf` decorator. This ensures that Fused can correctly resolve the module reference.

```python
@fused.udf(
    headers=['utils.py']
)
def udf(bbox):
    from utils import arr_to_plasma
    ...
    return arr_to_plasma(arr.values, min_max=(0, .8))
```


### From GitHub

Fused UDFs support importing utility modules from other UDFs, allowing teams and the community to share and reuse version-controlled helper functions. Once a module is loaded, it behaves like a standard Python module, enabling you to access its functions and objects using dot notation.

To load a UDF, use the [fused.load](/python-sdk/top-level-functions/#load) function and reference its utility module. For instance, consider a file named `utils`, located within a UDF named `common`, containing the `table_to_tile` helper function. Note the inclusion of the commit SHA `0dcc8` in the URL, which ensures that the UDF is loaded from a specific commit, providing consistency and version control.


```python
my_utils = fused.load(
    "https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/blob/0dcc8/public/common/"
    ).utils

my_utils.table_to_tile(...)
```

### From a user's account

```python
utils = fused.load("user@fused.io/my_udf").utils
```

### Exporting modules

A module goes wherever its UDF goes.

This means that when a user saves, exports, shares, or uploads a UDF, the code for the module and for the UDF stays together and the import statement works the same. For example, clicking "Download" on a UDF downloads a `.zip` file containing a `.py` file for each with both the module and the UDF code.

> 💡 Note: At the moment, UDFs in the Workbench have a single module. To support advanced use cases, the Python SDK support multiple modules per UDF.

## Visualization

A layer is a geo visualization that made up of the UDF's Python code, the output of its execution, and associated visual configurations like color, line width, etc. In the Workbench, layers have a 1:1 relationship with UDFs.

The [Layer styling](/workbench/viz-styling/) section dives into how to configure the visual representation of a UDF's output.

### Powered by deck.gl

Fused maps data (a vector or raster output from a UDF) as a stack of visual layers. To display it, Fused uses the industry standard [deck.gl TileLayer](https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/geo-layers/tile-layer) - an open source, high-performance data visualization framework. This means users can feel right at home with programmatic control of each aspect of rendering.

## Settings

The settings tab is where each UDF can be configured. This section provides quick access to caching and to metadata associated with discoverability and the UDF's profile card.

![Alt text](https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/docs_assets/image-27.png)

### Cache

UDFs run code remotely and return outputs to the browser over the network. Consequently, the map may feel sloggy if UDFs return a large data volume. To resolve this, users can enable caching to store the UDF's returned data in S3.

> 💡 Note that when a UDF's cache is enabled, its output data is stored by default in a Fused-managed S3 bucket. Fused is serious about giving users full control over where their data is stored. Get in touch to set your own bucket.

### Share & snippets

Once a user creates a UDF in the Workbench, they can use shared endpoint and snippets to call it and load its output it into other workflows. The "Share" and "Snippets" sections shows copyable code snippets to trigger the UDF from within different applications.



## Generate endpoints with Workbench * move this section to workbench, 

Once a UDF is saved in Workbench, the "Settings" tab of the editor shows code snippets that can be used to call the UDF from different environments. 

:::note
    Endpoints can be called with "private" or "shared" authentication tokens. Shared tokens are easy to create and revoke. Use shared tokens to call UDFs from 3rd party applications or to share them with others.
:::


### Shareable public endpoints

The "Share" subsection contains snippets with shared tokens and signed URLs. 
- `HTTP` is the URL to call the UDF endpoint.
- `cURL` is the command to call the UDF endpoint from the terminal.
- `Python` is the code to call the UDF endpoint from a Python environment using the token.
- `Token` is the shared token, which you'll notice appears in the above snippets. 


{/* ## TODO: move this section to workbench, especially the image. */}

import ImageShare from '@site/static/img/share.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImageShare} alt="File" style={{width: '80%'}} />
</div>


### Private endpoints

The "Snippets" subsection below it contains snippets that can only be called with the authoring account's authentication.
- `cURL` is the command to call the UDF endpoint from the terminal, which requires the authoring account's private token.
- `Python` is the code to call the UDF endpoint from a Python environment using the token.
- `Load this UDF` is loads the UDF into a Python environment where it can be modified, chained with other UDFs, or called. 


import ImageSnippets from '@site/static/img/snippets.png';

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={ImageSnippets} alt="File" style={{width: '80%'}} />
</div>


################################################################
#### Share

Generate signed tokens that allow anyone with the token to call the UDF. These tokens can be revoked.

![Alt text](https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/docs_assets/gifs/templated_share_snippets.gif)

#### Snippets

By default, UDFs can only be called by user account that creates them. This can be done with the snippets below.

![Alt text](https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/docs_assets/snippets2.png)

### Default parameter values

UDFs can be called with the parameters they explicitly define. Typed parameters can be set manually or automatically inferred within workbench, then used to trigger parametrized UDF runs via API. It's also possible to set predefined values that appear as options.

![Alt text](https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/docs_assets/gifs/parameters.gif)

### Default view state

Setting a default view state on a published or shared UDF helps users navigate to a default viewport. That viewport can optionally be enabled and configured in this section. These values can be set manually or automatically by clicking "Set current map view".

![Alt text](https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/docs_assets/default_view_state.png)

UDFs with the default view state enabled show a "Zoom to layer" button. Clicking it sets the viewport to the preconfigured state.

### Tags

Tags relevant to the UDF to make it easy to find in the Explorer search.

![Alt text](https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/docs_assets/image-31.png)

### Description

It's good practice to document UDFs with a brief description of their purpose, code, and datasets they import Markdown text box to include general information about the UDF. The markdown supports links, code blocks, and headers.
