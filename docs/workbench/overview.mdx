Workbench is a browser-based platform with 4 applications to build with data. It offers developers immediate access to their data and instant feedback as they open files, write code, transform data, and build apps.

The [User Defined Function (UDF)](/core-concepts/why/) is at the core of Fused and connects the 4 applications, enabling users to go from file to app in minutes. Users browse datasets in the [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/) and open them as UDFs, convert them into analytics scripts in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/), share them in the [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog), and finally turn them into shareable apps with the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/).

Workbench supports building end-to-end development workflows in minutes, but every component is fully replaceable. File Explorer can be swapped out with upstream database connections (like [BigQuery](/user-guide/in/bigquery/), [GEE](/user-guide/in/gee/), and [more](/user-guide/in/)), and the App Builder can be replaced with downstream third-party apps (like [DeckGL](/user-guide/out/deckgl/), [Retool](/user-guide/out/retool/), and [more](/user-guide/out/)).

But this is more than just a tool to work with data â€” Fused is a portal to a community where creators share their UDFs, apps, and expertise to help each other improve their work.
