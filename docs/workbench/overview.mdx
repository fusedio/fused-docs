Workbench is a browser-based IDE to build with data.

It offers developers immediate access to their data and instant feedback as they write code to transform data and build apps. But it's more than just a tool to work with data â€” it's a portal to a community where creators share their UDFs, apps, and expertise to help each other improve their work.

In the the data science and analytics process, practitioners need to efficiently find and load data, apply transformations, and share insights with stakeholders. Workbench supports this progression with a suite of integrated tools.


- Interactively write data analysis scripts as UDFs in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/)
- Browse and preview datasets with the [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/), and quickly open them in the UDF Builder with [template UDFs](/workbench/file-explorer/#template-udfs)
- Search and share UDFs in the [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog/), and run them in the UDF Builder
- [Call UDFs](/workbench/app-builder/#call-udfs) by creating and sharing apps with the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/)
