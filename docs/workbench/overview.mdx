Workbench is the browser-based IDE to build with data. It's designed to give developers immediate access to data and instant feedback as they write code.

- Browse datasets with the [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/)
- Search and clone UDFs in the [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog/)
- Create and share UDFs in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/)
- Build and share data apps in the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/)


Access it at [fused.io/workbench](https://www.fused.io/workbench).
