Workbench is a browser-based IDE designed to build with data. It offers developers immediate access to their data and instant feedback as they write code. But it's more than just a tool to work with data â€” it's a portal to a community where creators share their UDFs, apps, and expertise to help each other improve their work.

In the data science and analytics workflow, practitioners need to efficiently find data, apply transformations, and share insights with stakeholders. Workbench supports this process with a suite of integrated tools.


- Interactively write data analysis scripts as UDFs in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/)
- Browse and preview datasets with the [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/), and quickly open them with file-reader UDFs in the UDF Builder
- Search and share UDFs in the [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog/), and run them in the UDF Builder
- Create and share apps in the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/) that can interact with UDFs
