Workbench is a browser-based platform to build with data. It offers developers immediate access to their data and instant feedback as they open files, write code to transform data, and build apps.

Users browse datasets in the [File Explorer](/workbench/file-explorer/) and open them as UDFs, convert them into analytics scripts in the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/), share them in the [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog), and finally turn them into shareable apps with the [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/). These all revolve around and interact with [User Defined Functions (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/) - Python functions used to read files, process data, and power apps.

Workbench supports building end-to-end analytics workflows in minutes, but every one of its components is fully replaceable. File Explorer can be swapped out with upstream database connections (like [BigQuery](/examples/in/bigquery/), [GEE](/examples/in/gee/), and [others](/examples/in/)), and the App Builder can be replaced with downstream third-party apps (like [DeckGL](/examples/out/deckgl/), [Retool](/examples/out/retool/), and [others](/examples/out/)).

But Workbench is more than just a platform to work with data — it's a portal to a community where creators share their UDFs, apps, and expertise to help each other improve their work.
