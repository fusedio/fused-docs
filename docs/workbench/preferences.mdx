You can access the Preferences page from Workbench by clicking on Preferences in the bottom-left corner.

This page contains general user preferences, experimental features, theme selection, data settings, and other customization options.

This page is roughly split in 2 sections:

![preferences page sections](/img/workbench/preferences/top_level_preference.png)

- **Environment**: Setting up [kernels](/workbench/preferences/#kernel), [Secret management](/workbench/preferences/#secrets-management) and [environment variables](/workbench/preferences/#environment-variables). See below for details.
- **General Preferences**: Such as theme, file formats, etc. These are also searchable from [Command Palette](/user-guide/best-practices/workbench-best-practices/#using-keyboard-shortcuts-command-palette).

## Kernel

Selecting a kernel in Workbench sets the environment for your session, providing access to Python libraries at runtime. Contact the Fused team through Slack, [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BxS5wMzdRk) or email to set up new kernels.

## Secrets management

Store and manage secrets that are securely encrypted in the backend.

![secrets management](/img/workbench/preferences/secrets_management.png)

Add secrets directly in the UI by clicking "+ Add new secret"

You can then retrieve secrets from your UDF:

```python showLineNumbers
import fused
fused.secrets["my_secret"]
```

You can also list all available secrets with:

```python showLineNumbers
dir(fused.secrets)
```


## Environment variables

![env variables](/img/workbench/preferences/env_variables.png)

Environment variables in Fused are pre-configured by the Fused team. Contact the Fused team to set new ones. 

These variables can be accessed in the usual way through Python's os module:

```python showLineNumbers
import os
os.environ["ENV_VAR_NAME"]
```
