You can access the Preferences page from Workbench by clicking on Preferences in the bottom-left corner.

This page contains general user preferences, experimental features, theme selection, data settings, and other customization options.

import preferences from '/img/workbench/preferences/new_preferences.png';

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src={preferences} alt="File" style={{ width: '90%' }} />
</div>

## Kernel

Selecting a kernel in Workbench sets the environment for your session, providing access to Python libraries at runtime.

## Secrets management

Store and manage secrets that are securely encrypted in the backend.

Add and edit snippets, and copy snippets to access them. Use the following syntax to retrieve a snippet from your UDF:

```python showLineNumbers
import fused
fused.secrets["my_secret"]
```

You can also list all available secrets with:

```python showLineNumbers
dir(fused.secrets)
```


## Environment variables
Environment variables in Fused are pre-configured by the Fused team. These variables can be accessed in the usual way through Python's os module:

```python showLineNumbers
import os
os.environ["ENV_VAR_NAME"]
```
