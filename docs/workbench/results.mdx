## Results

Exploratory data analysis is characterized by logs & print statements, previewing intermediary outputs, and sifting through error logs. The results section is designed with the developer in mind - it dynamically surfaces only the information that is relevant at each moment. It shows content related to the UDF execution in 4 tabs which include `stderr` and `stdout` logs, and specifics about the present tile.

> 💡 All UDF logs associated with or resulting from user code are ephemeral. They are passed to the frontend for debugging purposes, but are not persisted anywhere.

#### Toolbar

The toolbar atop the Results pane is where buttons to download the viewport data and UDF response objecs.

### Stdout

The "Stdout" tab shows the UDF's `stdout`, which includes logs or print statements. Its toolbar has buttons to download the stdout as a text file and the results as a GeoJSON, when applicable.

> 💡 Pro-tip: Within the result box, `CMD` + Click on a URL opens it in a new tab.


### Errors

The "Errors" tab contains the `stderr` trace if the UDF execution raises an error, and the toolbar has a button to download it. This helps developers debug UDF code.
