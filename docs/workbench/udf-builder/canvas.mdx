A Canvas is a way for users to organize their UDFs into different projects. This allows you to use Workbench for completely different, unrelated projects and organise your UDFs in a cleaner way. 

With Canvas, you can:
- Save all current open UDFs into a Canvas (after giving it a name)
- Upload / Download Canvas via Workbench (Click the 3 dots next to Canvas name)
- Delete Canvas (this doesn't delete the UDFs inside, only the Canvas)

We are actively working on expanding Canvas features!
