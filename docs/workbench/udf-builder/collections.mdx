A Collection is a way for users to organize their UDFs into different projects. This allows you to use Workbench for completely different, unrelated projects and organise your UDFs in a cleaner way. 

With Collections, you can:
- Save all current open UDFs into a Collection (after giving it a name)
- Upload / Download Collections via Workbench (Click the 3 dots next to Collection name)
- Delete Collections (this doesn't delete the UDFs inside, only the Collection)

We are actively working on expanding Collection features!
