A Collection is a way for users to organize their UDFs into different projects. This allows you to use Workbench for completely different, unrelated projects and organise your UDFs in a cleaner way. 

:::note
Collection is still in Beta so you need to enable it under "Preferences -> Enable UDF Collections [Beta]" to access it

:::

You can:
- Save all current open UDFs into a Collection (after giving it a name)
- Upload / Download Collections via Workbench (Click the 3 dots next to Collection name)
- Delete Collections (this doesn't delete the UDFs inside, only the Collection)

We are actively working on expanding Collection features!
