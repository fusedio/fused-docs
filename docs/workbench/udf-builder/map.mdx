As developers edit UDFs in the [Code Editor](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/) and explore data, they can receive immediate visual feedback on how code affects the data.

## Geospatial data

Workbench can render `gpd.GeoDataFrame`, `gpd.GeoSeries`, and `shapely geometry` UDF outputs as geometries on the map - otherwise Fused will make a best-effort to convert and render them.

`uint8` Array (raster) objects with spatial metadata, like `xarray.DataArray`, also render on the map. Arrays without spatial metadata, like `numpy.ndarray`, can be can have their spatial extent specified with a geometry object or an array bounds as `[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]`. If the bounds are not present, they default to `(-180, -90, 180, 90)`. For example:



```python
return np.array([[…], […]]), [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]
```

In the case of UDFs that render [map Tiles](/core-concepts/filetile/#map-tiles), Fused runs the UDF for only the Tiles in the viewport. This enables developing on the fraction of a dataset corresponding to the viewport area then easily running the UDF for other areas.

### Map controls

The map can be panned by dragging the viewport, zoomed in and out, and rotated with `CMD` + Scroll.

The top of the map has controls to interact with the viewport. These include an address search bar, a basemap selector, a screenshot button, a fullscreen toggle, and a dropdown to pause, resume, or reset UDF execution.

## Debug

Click on map features to enter debug mode.

When data renders successfully on the map, clicking or hovering on it shows attributes for selected pixels or geometries. When data doesn't render, clicking errored areas shows error messages and debugging information. Additional debugging information can be found in the [Results](/workbench/udf-builder/results/) pane.

Exit debug mode with "Escape" key or by clicking "Clear debug selection" in the bottom right-hand of the map.
