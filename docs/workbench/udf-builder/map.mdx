As developers edit UDFs in the [Code Editor](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/) and explore data, they can receive immediate visual feedback on how the code's transformations affect the data.

## Geospatial data

Fused will render `gpd.GeoDataFrame`, `gpd.GeoSeries`, and `shapely geometry` UDF outputs as geometries on the map if their CRS is `EPSG:4326`. If the CRS differs, Fused will make a best effort to project and render the geometries correctly.

To render array (raster) objects on the map, they must be `uint8` and define their spatial extent. Objects like `xarray.DataArray` already contain spatial metadata. The spatial extent of arrays without spatial metadata, like `numpy.ndarray`, can be specified with a geometry object or an array bounds as `[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]`. If the bounds are not present, they default to `(-180, -90, 180, 90)`.
```python showLineNumbers
return np.array([[…], […]]), [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]
```

For UDFs that return [map Tiles](/core-concepts/filetile/#map-tiles), Fused runs the UDF for only the Tiles in the viewport. This enables efficient analysis on a fraction of a dataset.

### Map controls

The map can be panned by dragging the viewport, zoomed in and out, and rotated with `CMD` + Click + drag.

The top of the map has controls to interact with the viewport. These include an address search bar, a [basemap selector](https://docs.mapbox.com/#maps), a screenshot button, a fullscreen toggle, and a dropdown to freeze, resume, or reset UDF execution.

## Debug

Clicking a rendered feature enters debug mode. Pressing "Escape" or clicking "Clear debug selection" at the bottom of the map exits debug mode.

When data renders successfully on the map, clicking or hovering on it shows attributes for selected pixels or geometries. When data doesn't render, clicking errored tiles shows error messages and debugging information. Additional debugging information can be found in the [Results](/workbench/udf-builder/results/) pane.
