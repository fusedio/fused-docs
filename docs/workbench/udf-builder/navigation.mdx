The Navigation pane on the left side of the UDF Builder displays the UDFs available to the user. UDFs are listed as layers. Their order corresponds to their stacking order on the map. Each layer includes icons to delete, reorder, and toggle the visibility of UDFs.

The selected layer becomes the "active" layer. Its code appears in the [Code Editor](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/) and its output in the [Results](/workbench/udf-builder/results/) pane.

If a UDF returns an object with a spatial component or has a [default view state](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/#default-view-state), the "zoom to layer" icon will appear. Clicking it zooms the map to the relevant location.
