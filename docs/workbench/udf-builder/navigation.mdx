The Navigation pane on the left side of the UDF Builder displays the UDFs available to the user. UDFs are listed as layers. Their order corresponds to their stacking order on the map. Each layer includes icons to delete, reorder, and toggle the visibility of UDFs. The selected layer becomes the "active" layer. Its code appears in the [Code Editor](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/) and its output in the [Results](/workbench/udf-builder/results/) pane.

## Zoom to Layer

"Zoom to layer" allows you to quickly zoom the map to the location of the relevant UDF layer. You would use it when you want to focus the map on a specific area or features defined by the layer, especially when the UDF has a spatial component or a default view state.
UDFs that return an object with a spatial component or have a [default view state](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/#default-view-state) show a "zoom to layer". Clicking it zooms the map to the relevant location.

## Layer Visibility

The layer toggle feature allows users to show or hide specific visualizations on the map. These layers provide enhanced map insights, making spatial data easier to understand and interpret.

## UDF Options

The UDF list includes several interactive options to manage and organize functions efficiently.

### Drag and Drop

Users can reorder UDFs by dragging them up and down within the list. To do this, they need to hover over the UDF name to see the drag handle.

### Close/Delete

If the UDF is saved, a "Close UDF" button is available to exit the editor. If the UDF is unsaved and still being edited, a "Delete UDF" button replaces it, allowing users to discard the changes.

## Share

The Share button in Workbench provides access to all options to share the UDF.

### Share snippets

UDFs saved in the UDF Builder can be called with [HTTP endpoints](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#http-requests) using [the public UDF name](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#public-udf-name) and/or [tokens](/core-concepts/run-udfs/run-small-udfs/#token).

The "Shared token" section shows snippets to run the UDF using a public token. This allows any application to invoke the UDF without authentication - including `cURL` calls, [Lonboard](/user-guide/out/lonboard/), [Leaflet](/user-guide/out/leaflet/), [Mapbox](/user-guide/out/mapbox/), [Google Sheets](/user-guide/out/googlesheets/), [DuckDB](/user-guide/out/duckdb/), the Fused [App Builder](/workbench/app-builder/), and Python applications with [`fused.run`](/core-concepts/run-udfs/).

### Private snippets

Private snippets are now located under the "Shared token" section in the "Share" view. The "Private snippets" section shows snippets that can only be called by services authenticated with a private token. These include `Links` and `Python snippets`.

### Metadata

#### Image preview

#### Tags

UDF tags can be set to help with discoverability in the [UDF Catalog](/workbench/udf-catalog/).

![Image tags](/img/workbench/udf-builder/tags.png)

#### Description

UDFs can be documented using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) with a brief description of their purpose, code, and associated datasets. The description appears in the UDF profile and `README.md` file.

## Toolbar

The toolbar under the UDF name includes buttons to Share, Save and Download. Additional actions like Duplicate, Delete, Pull changes, and Push changes are available via the three-dot menu on the right.

### GitHub

Organizations with the [GitHub Integration](/core-concepts/content-management/git/#connect-your-github-repository) enabled can push UDFs to a GitHub repository as a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) or restore a prior version of a UDF from the commit history.

### Download

Clicking "Download" downloads a `.zip` file with the UDF code, module, and configuration.

### Default parameter values

UDFs by default run with the [parameters](/core-concepts/write/#typed-parameters) specified in their [function declaration](/core-concepts/write/#function-declaration). Predefined default parameter values take precedence and appearing within the Parameters section on the left side of the screen, under the selected UDF's options.
