The Navigation pane on the left side of the UDF Builder displays the UDFs available to the user. UDFs are listed as layers. Their order corresponds to their stacking order on the map. Each layer includes icons to delete, reorder, and toggle the visibility of UDFs. The selected layer becomes the "active" layer. Its code appears in the [Code Editor](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/) and its output in the [Results](/workbench/udf-builder/results/) pane.

## Zoom to Layer

"Zoom to layer" allows you to quickly zoom the map to the location of the relevant UDF layer. You would use it when you want to focus the map on a specific area or features defined by the layer, especially when the UDF has a spatial component or a default view state.
UDFs that return an object with a spatial component or have a [default view state](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/#default-view-state) show a "zoom to layer". Clicking it zooms the map to the relevant location.

## Layer Visibility

The layer toggle feature allows users to show or hide specific visualizations on the map. These layers provide enhanced map insights, making spatial data easier to understand and interpret.

## UDF Options

The UDF list includes several interactive options to manage and organize functions efficiently.

### Drag and Drop

Users can reorder UDFs by dragging them up and down within the list. To do this, they need to hover over the UDF name to see the drag handle.

### Close/Delete

If the UDF is saved, a "Close UDF" button is available to exit the editor. If the UDF is unsaved and still being edited, a "Delete UDF" button replaces it, allowing users to discard the changes.

#### Default parameter values

UDFs by default run with the [parameters](/core-concepts/write/#typed-parameters) specified in their [function declaration](/core-concepts/write/#function-declaration). Predefined default parameter values take precedence and appearing within the Parameters section on the left side of the screen, under the selected UDF's options.
