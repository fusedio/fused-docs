The Navigation pane, located on the left side of the UDF Builder, displays the UDFs available to the user. UDFs are listed as layers, with their order reflecting their stacking order on the map. Each layer includes icons to delete, reorder, and toggle the visibility of UDFs.

Selecting a layer makes it the "active" layer, displaying its associated code in the [Code Editor](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/) and its output in the [Results](/workbench/udf-builder/results/) pane.

If a UDF returns an object with a spatial component or has "default view state" enabled, the "zoom to layer" icon will appear. Clicking it zooms the map to the relevant location.
