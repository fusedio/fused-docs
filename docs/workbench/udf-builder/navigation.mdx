The Navigation pane on the left side of the UDF Builder displays the UDFs available to the user. UDFs are listed as layers. Their order corresponds to their stacking order on the map. Each layer includes icons to delete, reorder, and toggle the visibility of UDFs. The selected layer becomes the "active" layer. Its code appears in the [Code Editor](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/) and its output in the [Results](/workbench/udf-builder/results/) pane.

UDFs that return an object with a spatial component or have a [default view state](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/#default-view-state) show a "zoom to layer". Clicking it zooms the map to the relevant location.
