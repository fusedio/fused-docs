In the UDF Builder, developers can quickly iterate on UDF code and immediately see its impact on the data.

This responsiveness is achieved through strategic data caching and partitioning, enabling Fused to interactively load, process, and visualize any datasets of any size directly from their source.

- Write UDFs in the [Code Editor](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/)
- Manage UDFs as map layers in the [Navigation pane](/workbench/udf-builder/navigation/)
- Preview the UDF's output on the [Map](/workbench/udf-builder/map/) and [style](/workbench/udf-builder/styling/) its visualization
- View the UDF's logs in the [Results](/workbench/udf-builder/results/) pane

## Build UDFs

Developers [write](/core-concepts/write/) and manage UDFs in the Code Editor. Click the "New UDF" button to open a template as a map layer. As you edit code, the UDF automatically runs then shows its [return object](/core-concepts/write/#return-object) on the map and its logs in the [`results` pane](/workbench/udf-builder/results/#stdout).

Get familiar with the editor by typing in the code editor.

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

You can, for example, write a UDF to load [U.S. Census](https://www2.census.gov/) polygons with [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/index.html). Copy and paste this snippet to replace the UDF code in your editor. It will create a `GeoDataFrame` from the census data ZIP file, print the first rows in the console, and render it as polygons on the map. Once data renders, navigate the map.


```python
@fused.udf
def udf():
    import geopandas as gpd
    url = "https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/STATE/11_DISTRICT_OF_COLUMBIA/11/tl_rd22_11_bg.zip"
    gdf = gpd.read_file(url)
    print(gdf.head())
    return gdf
```
