Exploring and analyzing data involves scanning logs, previewing intermediary outputs, and debugging errors.

This section of the UDF Builder dynamically displays information related to the UDF execution on the [toolbar](/workbench/udf-builder/results/#toolbar) and across the [Stdout](/workbench/udf-builder/results/#stdout), [Selected object](/workbench/udf-builder/results/#selected-object), and [Request details](/workbench/udf-builder/results/#request-details) tabs.


### Toolbar

The toolbar at the top of the Results pane shows the latitude and longitude of the viewport center, average UDF execution time, and a button to exit the map [Debug mode](/workbench/udf-builder/map/#debug).



## Stdout

The "Stdout" tab shows the UDF's `stdout` logs, and the `stderr` trace if execution raises an error. These logs are ephemeral - they are passed to the frontend for debugging but are not persisted anywhere.

## Selected object

This tab shows a GeoJSON of the object that is selected on the map.

## Request details

When a UDF runs as Tile, this last tab shows a GeoJSON with the geometry and properties for the `bbox` object the UDF was called with.
