The UDF Builder is an IDE to write [User Defined Function (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/) and visualize their output. It enables developers to intuitively write UDFs and instantly see the effect of the code on their data.

Data analysis is inherently iterative. It involves loading data, writing code, executing the code, and visualizing results. The UDF Builder streamlines this workflow by providing a unified interface to write, run, and visualize UDFs. Developers can write UDFs in the Code Editor, preview the output on the Map, and style the visualization. Additionally, the Results pane displays logs and errors generated by the UDF to help with debugging.



- Write UDFs in the [Code Editor](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/)
- Manage UDFs as map layers in the [Navigation pane](/workbench/udf-builder/navigation/)
- Preview the UDF's output on the [Map](/workbench/udf-builder/map/) and [style](/workbench/udf-builder/styling/) its visualization
- View the UDF's logs in the [Results](/workbench/udf-builder/results/) pane
