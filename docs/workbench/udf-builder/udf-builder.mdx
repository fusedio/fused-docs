The UDF Builder is an IDE to write [User Defined Function (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/) and visualize their output.

Data analysis is inherently iterative. It involves loading data, writing code, executing the code, and visualizing results.

As developers write and debug their code, Fused gives them immediate feedback by automatically re-running the UDF and showing the output. Developers can write UDFs in the Code Editor, preview the output on the Map, and style the visualization. To help debug, the Results pane displays logs and errors generated by the UDF.



- Write UDFs in the [Code Editor](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/)
- Manage UDFs as map layers in the [Navigation pane](/workbench/udf-builder/navigation/)
- Preview the UDF's output on the [Map](/workbench/udf-builder/map/) and edit the [Layer Styling](/workbench/udf-builder/styling/) its visualization
- View the UDF's logs in the [Results](/workbench/udf-builder/results/) pane
