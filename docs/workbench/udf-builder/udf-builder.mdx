The UDF Builder is styled like an IDE so developers feel right at home. Just like an IDE, the main interface is the code editor. However, Workbench takes it to the next level by deeply integrating the code editor to the adjacent [deck.gl](http://deck.gl) map and expanding their joint capabilities in significant ways.
