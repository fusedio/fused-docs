The UDF Catalog offers a searchable collection of [User Defined Functions (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/) that can be imported into the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) for editing. It facilitates sharing and discovering UDFs within teams and the broader Fused community.

Data teams frequently encounter silos when looking to share reuse code snippets & data across different projects. Traditional notebooks pose challenges in version control, sharing individual utility functions, managing dependencies, and reproducing results in new environments. Additionally, generated assets are often disconnected from the code. UDFs, however, encapsulate modules, outputs, and code, addressing issuess related to lineage and reproducibility.
