The UDF Catalog provides a searchable collection of UDFs you can import into your [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) for editing. It enables you to share and discover reusable code snippets within the Fused community and your team.



Data teams often need to share and reuse code snippets across projects. Traditional notebooks make it difficult to version control, share individual utility functions, and install dependencies & reproduce results in a new environment. Additionally, generated assets are often disconnected from the code. UDFs, however, encapsulate modules, outputs, and code, addressing issuess related to lineage and reproducibility.

- [Search](/workbench/udf-catalog/#search) the catalog across [UDF categories](/workbench/udf-catalog/#udf-categories)
- View the detailed [profile](/workbench/udf-catalog/#udf-profile) for each UDF
