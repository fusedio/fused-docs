The UDF Catalog offers a searchable collection of [User Defined Functions (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/) that can be imported into the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) for editing. It facilitates sharing and discovering UDFs within teams and the broader Fused community.

Data teams frequently encounter silos when looking to share and reuse code snippets & data across different projects. Traditional notebooks pose challenges in version control, sharing individual utility functions, managing dependencies, and reproducing results in new environments. Additionally, assets often end up disconnected from the code that generated them. UDFs on the other hand encapsulate modules, outputs, and code, which addresses issuess related to reproducibility and lineage.

</div>



## Search


Open the UDF Catalog by Clicking "Add UDF". Search UDFs by name, sort them, and toggle between gallery and list views. Click UDF cards to view their profiles or add them to the UDF Builder.

### UDF categories

- **Public UDFs:** Verified and accessible to all users
- **Community UDFs:** Shared by the community and accessible to all users
- **Team UDFs:** Shared privately within a team in a [GitHub](/core-concepts/content-management/git/) repo
- **Saved UDFs:** Private UDFs in the user's account


## Add from GitHub URL

If [GitHub integration is enabled](/core-concepts/content-management/git/) on your Workbench, you can paste the link of any UDF from GitHub to open it. This allows you to open a UDF from any branch or revision from GitHub.

## UDF profile

Select a UDF to view its profile which includes the [`README.md` description](/workbench/udf-builder/code-editor/#description), last update date, author, link to its code on GitHub, and code preview.

## Contribute to Fused

Fused welcomes your skills and enthusiasm in support of the geospatial community!

There are numerous opportunities to get involved, from contributing code to engaging the community on Discord, LinkedIn, and other social media platforms.

### Where to start?

A good place to start is to acquaint yourself with Fused by reading this documentation site and joining the conversation in the [Fused Discord channel](https://bit.ly/fused-discord).

If you are brand new to Fused or open-source development, we recommend going through the [Fused UDFs GitHub](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs). There you'll be able to run sample UDFs in your local Python environment and familiarize yourself with how to write geospatial operations.

### Share a UDF with the community

Once you get acquainted, we encourage you to write a UDF and share it with the world by submitting a Pull Request into the repo. Publishing a UDF this way will allow others to reproduce and reuse your code, and even provide insight into improving it.

When you contribute a UDF to the community, it will appear in the Fused UDF Catalog under the 'Community' tab, along with other shared UDFs. You can also view your contributed UDFs in the 'Saved' tab." Your GitHub handle will be listed as the author and will link back to your GitHub profile.

</div>

### Publish a UDF to a GitHub repository

Once you write a UDF, you can use the Push to GitHub button in Fused Workbench to publish or update your UDF in a GitHub repository. You will be able to select the repository (e.g., fusedudf, community, or public) and automatically create a pull request on GitHub.

To enable the GitHub integration, you need to click on Preferences in the bottom left corner, then select Enable GitHub Integration.

To add a UDF to the community repository, select community from the dropdown before creating a pull request.
