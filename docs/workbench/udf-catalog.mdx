The UDF Catalog provides a collection of portable and modular UDFs. It allows you to share and discover reusable code snippets within the Fused community and your team. UDFs from the Catalog can be easily opened and edited in the UDF Builder, streamlining collaboration and code reuse.



Data teams often need to share and reuse code snippets across projects. Traditional notebooks often come with challenges: installing dependencies, lack modularity, hard to share individual utility functions out of context, and might fail to execute when trying to reproduce results. Additionally, generated assets are ofter disconnected from t he code. UDFs self-contain modules, outputs, and code, addressing issuess related to lineage and reproducibility.
