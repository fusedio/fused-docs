The UDF Catalog offers a searchable collection of [User Defined Functions (UDFs)](/core-concepts/why/) that can be imported into the [UDF Builder](/workbench/udf-builder/) for editing. It facilitates sharing and discovering UDFs within teams and the broader Fused community.

Data teams frequently encounter silos when looking to share and reuse code snippets & data across different projects. Traditional notebooks pose challenges in version control, sharing individual utility functions, managing dependencies, and reproducing results in new environments. Additionally, assets often end up disconnected from the code that generated them. UDFs on the other hand encapsulate modules, outputs, and code, which addresses issuess related to reproducibility and lineage.


- Create a [new UDF](/workbench/udf-catalog/#add-a-udf)
- [Search](/workbench/udf-catalog/#search) the catalog across [UDF categories](/workbench/udf-catalog/#udf-categories)
- View the detailed [profile](/workbench/udf-catalog/#udf-profile) for each UDF
- Add any UDF from its [Github URL](/workbench/udf-catalog/#add-from-github-url)
- Delete a UDF you created yourself
- Upload UDFs from JSON ot ZIP files

## Add a UDF

Create a new UDF by clicking the top-right "New UDF" button. This opens a UDF with a base template.
Alternatively, you can use the "Upload UDF" button to import an existing UDF from your local machine.

### UDF categories

- **All UDFs:** View all available UDFs in one place, including all categories listed below.
- **Public UDFs:** Verified and accessible to all users
- **Community UDFs:** Shared by the community and accessible to all users
- **Team UDFs:** Shared privately within a team in a [GitHub](/core-concepts/content-management/git/) repo
- **Saved UDFs:** Private UDFs in the user's account


## Add from GitHub URL

If [GitHub integration is enabled](/core-concepts/content-management/git/#configuring-github-integration) on your Workbench, you can paste the link of any UDF from GitHub to open it. This allows you to open a UDF from any branch or revision from GitHub.

## UDF profile

Select a UDF to view its profile which includes the [`README.md` description](/workbench/udf-builder/navigation/#description), last update date, author, link to its code on GitHub, and code preview.

## Contribute to Fused

Fused welcomes your skills and enthusiasm in support of the geospatial community!

There are numerous opportunities to get involved, from contributing code to engaging the community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BxS5wMzdRk), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fusedio/), and other social media platforms.

### Where to start?

UDFs can be easily re-used, so before you build something new or share yours with the community, check the [UDF Catalog](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog) to see if someone has already built something you might benefit from! Here are a few examples of Public & Community UDFs:

- [Opening Overture Building Datasets](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Overture_Maps_Example-77970462-8c4d-44dd-87ad-3520f5d7bd83) to browse the latest building dataset from Overture's open data on [Source Coop](https://source.coop/repositories/fused/overture/description)
- [Exploring Sentinel 2 satellite imagery](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/Sentinel_Tile_Example-a6b7839c-4886-4ea7-b168-c5c763c02c18) by using [Microsoft's Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/sentinel-2-l2a) or [AWS Open Data Program](https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2/)
- [Computing height for buildings in the US using the ALOS 30m Digital Surface Model](https://www.fused.io/workbench/catalog/DSM_Zonal_Stats-0c801e56-d0c4-47e8-a5ce-90d37703bdb7)

### Publish a UDF to a GitHub repository

Once you write a UDF, you can use the Push to GitHub button in Fused Workbench to publish or update your UDF in a GitHub repository. You will be able to select the repository (e.g., `fusedudf`, `community`, or `public`) and automatically create a pull request on GitHub. Read how to [enable the GitHub integration](/core-concepts/content-management/git/#configuring-github-integration).

To add a UDF to the community repository, select community from the dropdown before creating a pull request.

:::info

Note that once the UDF is committed to the main branch of the repo, you can expect to wait up to 3 minutes for it to deploy and appear in the UDF Catalog.
