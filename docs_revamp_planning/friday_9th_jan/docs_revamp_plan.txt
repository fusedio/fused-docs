### Friday 9th Jan plan

# Revamp of docs structure

Goal: Docs to have 2 approaches: 

1. API reference (i.e. I want to do a hex aggregate with `mode` specifically → Show me exactly how I can do that)

- Want small snippets that I can copy / paste from different parts of the docs
- Much more like an exhaustive list of everything that’s available in Fused
- This would be used by user that knows exactly what they’re looking for
- Example of sections of docs like this:
    - DuckDB Data Import & Export: https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/data/overview
        - List of all the methods available, not a full example
    - Modal API Reference: https://modal.com/docs/reference
        - This is similar to our Python SDK section: [https://docs.fused.io/python-sdk](https://docs.fused.io/python-sdk/top-level-functions) in a way

1. Guides / for user who doesn’t even really know what they’re looking for 
    - Links to a lot of different elements in the API reference for more details
    - Explains the concepts, provides details for when to use / not use a tool. Example: 
        - H3 hexagons guide section should explain when to use H3, how to chose resolution, etc.
        - H3 reference should have code snippets for multiple types of operations I can easily search & copy paste without a deep context of H3, for users who know what they want to do, not necessarily how to do it
    - Examples of sections of docs doing this:
        - Modal Guide: https://modal.com/docs/guide
        - 10 minutes to Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html#


Some specifics of what I'd like to be able to have:
- Loading data from many different places. All these should be together as they're all related to loading data in
    - Tutorials / Geospatial /Read Data (simple snippets to load data in)
    - Load & export Data (/tutorials/load-export-data) -> Has things like SnowFlake or STAC Catalog
    - Google Earth Engine (tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/gee_bigquery) has how to load data from GEE as arr
- Dedicated section for H3 -> This is a big thing we want to dive deeper into this year
    - Want to have both API aspect (i.e. how do I join 2 datasets together) and examples / guide

Things I do like about current implementation though (but open to changing):
- We want to have entry points for "Data Science" / Data Engineer / Data Analyst 
- We separate quite clearly between geospatial / generic python. We are diving more & more into geospatial so it might not make as much sense to split

Some other considerations:
- I want us to rank well for H3 in SEO, so I want to have specific elements that help educate users about what's possible in H3 as standalone pages or at least headers that would be picked up in SEO well. Examples of what we already have:
    - Table for choosing the proper H3 resolution (in this section: /tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/h3-tiling/ingesting-dataset-to-h3#resolution-of-the-data-res)
    - Choosing best way to convert datasets to H3 (/tutorials/Geospatial%20with%20Fused/h3-tiling/when-to-use-h3#converting-datasets-to-h3-tiles)
- I want to rank high for people asking: When to use H3, how to convert their data to H3, and simple operation in H3 like aggregate & zonal stats 

Content naming:
- Fused is leaning into geospatial but we want to still be accessible to people who aren't knowledgable about geospatial. Assume people are smart and can figure things out but now necessarily knowledgable. Example:
    - In titles don't use specific datasets names like:
        - We don't want to mention "CDL Analysis" -> Crop analysis or 'Agriculture'
        - Not "Overture" but 'buildings dataset'
    - Lean towards explaining concepts and linking to existing resources as much as possible. For example:
        - STAC Catlog -> Link out to official stac page that explains what STAC is 
        - Snowflake -> Link to official snowflake page 


Structure of the repo
- I want to have the sub categories to have a flow from a user point of view. I'd like to keep it to 7 categories under the top level "Guide" if possible


Scoping
- I want to have a detailed plan with every single page laid out before we implement anything. I.e. I want to review that we either have every page that's in the current legacy docs, or make a decision to remove them. 
- Under each page I want to have the broad topics that will be inside it (i.e. cloud_storage.md - S3: Loading from S3, Writing to S3 - GCS: Loading from GCS, Writing to GCS)

Future considerations (things not currently in docs, that we'd like to add soon)
- Dedicated page on STAC processing (i.e. how to build your own STAC Catalog)
- Creating PM Tiles visualization for your dataset (with what the limits are, i.e. PMTiles are good for visualization but not analysis), steps for how to reproduce
    - After being done doing an analysis, how do I visualize a huge dataset best? This is what this section provides + shows how to connect to AI agent on top
- I'd like to have more examples for how to scale geospatial operations like doing zonal stats at scale with fused.submit by clipping a raster & vector into tiles, then running fused.submit(). This can go in use cases for details examples but I want to have small sections explaining basis to teach + show people what's possible
- I want to show people they can also go and download files like zip & rar in fused. We have sections for database, apis, etc. but sometimes there's also just getting a file from a legacy non cloud native format. Many other tools don't support this but we offer ability to write Python code to do that. I want users to see that when going over docs (it's not directly a feature of Fused, more something that's supported and possible to do)
- Want to have a section / somewhere explaining how best to work as a team & share work across team members
